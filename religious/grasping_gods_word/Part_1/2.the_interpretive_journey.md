# The Interpretive Journey

---

## Introduction

People all over the world love reading the Bible — and they have loved it for thousands of years. Why? People read the Bible because it is a fascinating book, filled with gripping stories and challenging exhortations. People read it because it is an important book, dealing with the big issues of life — God, eternal life, death, love, sin, and morals. People read it because they believe that in the Bible, God speaks to them through written words. The Bible encourages us, lifts our spirits, comforts us, guides us, chides us, builds us up, gives us hope, and brings us close to the living God.

**The process of interpreting and grasping the Bible is similar to embarking on a journey**. Reading the text thoroughly and carefully lies at the beginning of the journey. From this careful reading we become able to determine what the passage meant in the biblical context — that is, what it meant to the biblical audience.

> Often, however, when we try to apply this meaning directly to ourselves, we run into problems. **We are separated from the biblical audience by culture and customs, language, situation, and a vast expanse of time**. These differences form a barrier — a river that separates us from the text and that often prohibits us from grasping the meaning of the text for ourselves.

Thus, the river between the Old Testament text and us consists not only of culture, language, situation, and time, but also of covenant.

As a result, today’s Christian is often uncertain about how to interpret much of the Bible. Ex: Judges 6:37 Gideon puts out a fleece in order to confirm what God has told him. Does this mean that we should put out fleeces when we seek God’s leading?

> Any attempt to interpret and to apply the Bible involves trying to cross the river. While often unconscious of their interpretive method, many Christians today nonetheless frequently employ an intuitive or feels-right approach to interpretation. If the text looks as if it could be applied directly, then they attempt to apply it directly. If not, then they take a spiritualizing approach to the meaning — an approach that borders on allegorizing the biblical text (which shows little or no sensitivity to the biblical context). Or else they simply shrug their shoulders and move on to another passage, ignoring the meaning of the text altogether.
> 
> Such approaches will never land us safely on the other side of the river. Those using the intuitive approach blindly wade out into the river, hoping that the water is not more than knee deep. Sometimes they are fortunate and stumble onto a sandbar, but often they step out into deep water, and they end up washed ashore somewhere downstream. Those who spiritualize, by contrast, try to jump the river in one grand leap, but they also end up washed ashore downstream with their intuitive buddies. Shrugging or ignoring a passage is to remain on the far side of the river and simply to gaze across without even attempting to cross.
> 
> **Many Christians are admittedly uncomfortable with such approaches, recognizing the somewhat willy-nilly methodology and the extreme subjectivity involved, but they continue to use it because it is the only method they know.**

This book addresses how to cross over that river into the world of today. We need a valid, legitimate approach to the Bible, **one that is not based strictly on intuition and feeling**. We need an approach that derives meaning from within the text, but one that also crosses over to the situation for today’s Christian.

We also need a consistent approach, one that can be used on any passage. Such an approach should eliminate the habit of skipping over texts and surfing along through the Bible looking for passages that might apply.  A consistent approach should allow us to dig into any passage with a method to determine the meaning of that text for us today.

Our goal in this book is to take you on the journey across the river, `to transport you from the text and the world of the biblical audience to a valid understanding and application of the text for Christians today`

## Basics of the Journey

We do not create meaning out of a text; rather, we seek to find the meaning that is already there. However, we recognize that we cannot apply the meaning for the ancient audience directly to us today because of the river that separates us (culture, time, situation, covenant, etc.).

> This journey works on the premise that the Bible is a record of God’s communication of himself and his will to us. We revere the Bible and treat it as holy because it is the Word of God and because God reveals himself to us through this Word. Many texts in the Bible are specific, concrete, revelatory expressions of broader, universal realities or theological principles. While the specifics of a particular passage may only apply to the particular situation of the biblical audience, the theological principles revealed in that text are applicable to all of God’s people at all times. `The theological principle, therefore, has meaning and application both to the ancient biblical audience and to Christians today.`

Thus, our journey starts with a careful reading of the text.

#### Step 1: Grasping the Text in Their Town

Question: What did the text mean to the biblical audience?

In Step 1,  try to see as much as possible in the text. Look, look, and look again, observing all that you can. **Scrutinize the grammar and analyze all significant words**. Likewise, **study the historical and literary contexts**. How does your passage relate to those that precede it and those that follow it?

Then synthesize the meaning of the passage for the biblical audience into one or two sentences. That is, write out what the passage meant for the biblical audience. Use past-tense verbs and refer to the biblical audience. Example:

> God commanded the Israelites in Joshua 1 to ...
> Paul exhorted the Ephesians to ...
> Jesus encouraged his disciples by ...
> 
> **Be specific. Do not generalize or try to develop theological
> principles yet.**

#### Step 2: Measuring the WIdth of the River to Cross

Question: What are the differences between the biblical audience and us?

The Christian today is separated from the biblical audience by differences in culture, language, situation, time, and often covenant. These differences form a river that hinders us from moving straight from meaning in their context to meaning in ours. The width of the river, however, varies from passage to passage. Sometimes it is extremely wide, requiring a long, substantial bridge for crossing. Other times, however, it is a narrow creek that we can easily hop over. It is obviously important to know just how wide the river is before we start trying to construct a principlizing bridge across it.

![2.2.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_1/image/2.2.png)

In Step 2 you will take a good hard look at the river and determine just how wide it is for the passage you are studying. **In this step you look for significant differences between our situation today and the situation of the biblical audience**. If you are studying an Old Testament passage, also be sure to identify those significant theological differences that came as a result of the life and work of Jesus Christ.

In addition, whether in the Old Testament or in the New Testament, try to identify any unique aspects of the situation of your passage. Example: 

> In Joshua 1:1–9, the people of Israel are preparing to enter the Promised Land. Moses has just died and Joshua has been appointed to take his place. **In this passage God speaks to Joshua to encourage him to be strong and faithful in the upcoming conquest of the land**. What are the differences? **We are not entering or conquering the Promised Land. We are not the new leaders of the nation of Israel. We are not under the old covenant**.

#### Step 3: Crossing the Principlizing Bridge

Question: What is the theological principle in this text?

This is perhaps the most challenging step. In it you are looking for the theological principle or principles that are reflected in the meaning of the text you identified in Step 1. Remember that this theological principle is part of the meaning. **Your task is not to create the meaning but to discover the meaning intended by the author**. As God gives specific expressions to specific biblical audiences, **he is also giving universal theological teachings for all of his people through these same texts**.

![2.3.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_1/image/2.3.png)

To determine the theological principle, first recall the differences you identified in Step 2. Next, **try to identify any similarities between the situation of the biblical audience and our situation**. Example: 

> Joshua 1:1–9 again. Recall, of course, the differences that we identified in Step 2. But then note the similarities between the biblical situation and our own. We are also the people of God, in covenant relationship (new covenant); while we are not the leaders of Israel, nonetheless many of us are in leadership positions in the church; we are not invading the Promised Land, but we are seeking to obey the will of God and to accomplish what he has commanded us to do.
> 
> After reviewing the differences and identifying the similarities, return to the meaning for the biblical audience that you described in Step 1 and try to identify a broader theological principle reflected in the text, but also one that relates to the similarities between us and the biblical audience. In essence, .**the theological principle is the same as the “theological message” or the “main theological point” of the passage**. We will use this theological principle as the principlizing bridge by which we can cross over the river of differences.
> 
> The criteria for formulating the theological principle with the following:
> 
> - The principle should be reflected in the text.
> 
> - The principle should be timeless and not tied to a specific situation.
> 
> - The principle should not be culturally bound.
> 
> - The principle should correspond to the teaching of the rest of Scripture.
> 
> - The principle should be relevant to both the biblical and the contemporary audience.
> 
> Write out the theological principle (or principles) in one or two sentences. Use present-tense verbs.

#### Step 4: Consult the Biblical Map

Question: How does our theological principle fit with the rest of the Bible?

you reflect back and forth between the text and the teachings of the rest of Scripture. Is your principle consistent with the rest of Scripture? Do other portions of Scripture add insight or qualification to the principle? **If your principle is valid, it ought to “fit” or “correlate” with the rest of the Bible**.

![2.4.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_1/image/2.4.png)

#### Step 5: Grasping the Text in Our Town

Question: How should individual Christians today live out the theological principles?

In Step 5 we apply the theological principle to the specific situation of individual Christians in the church today. We cannot leave the meaning of the text stranded in an abstract theological principle. We must now grapple with how we should respond to that principle in our town. How does it apply in real-life situations today?

![2.5.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_1/image/2.5.png)

> While for each passage there will usually be only a few (and often only one) theological principles relevant for all Christians today, there will be numerous applicational possibilities. 
> 
> This is because Christians today find themselves in many different specific situations. Each of us will grasp and apply the same theological principle in slightly different ways, depending on our current life situation and where we are in our relationship with God.

 In our illustration, we have tried to show the different applications possible by showing different individuals traveling on different streets.

**So, the Interpretive Journey as a whole looks like this:**

- **Step 1:** Grasp the text in their town. What did the text mean to the original audience?

- **Step 2:** Measure the width of the river to cross. What are the differences between the biblical audience and us?

- **Step 3:** Cross the principlizing bridge. What is the theological principle in this text?

- **Step 4:** Consult the biblical map. How does our theological principle fit with the rest of the Bible?

- **Step 5:** Grasp the text in our town. How should individual Christians today live out the theological principles?

## An Example Joshua 1:1-9

#### Step 1: What did the text mean to the biblical audience?

The Lord commanded Joshua, the new leader of Israel, to draw *strength* and *courage* from **God’s empowering presence**, to be *obedient* to the law of Moses, and to meditate on the law so that he would be successful in the conquest of the Promised Land.

#### Step 2: What are the differences between the biblical audience and us?

We are not leaders of the nation Israel (although some of us may be leaders in the church). We are not embarking on the conquest of Canaan, the Promised Land. We are not under the old covenant of law.

#### Step 3: What is the theological principle in this text?

To be effective in serving God and successful in the task to which he has called us, we must draw *strength* and *courage* from **his presence**. We must also be *obedient* to God’s Word, *meditating* on it constantly.

#### Step 4: How does our theological principle fit with the rest of the Bible ?

**The rest of the Bible consistently affirms that God’s people can draw strength and courage from his presence.** In the New Testament believers experience God’s presence through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit rather than through his presence in the tabernacle. Likewise, throughout both the Old Testament and the New Testament God’s people are exhorted to pay close, obedient attention to his Word.

#### Step 5: How should individual Christians today live out the theological principles ?

- Spend more time meditating on God’s Word by listening to Christian music as you ride in your car.

- If God calls you to a new, scary ministry, such as teaching fourth-grade Sunday school, then be strengthened and encouraged by his empowering presence. Be obedient, keeping a focus on the Scriptures.

- If you are in a church leadership position, realize that successful Christian leadership requires strength and courage that flows from the presence of God.

## The Journey and Grasping God's Word

The Interpretive Journey is actually a blueprint for this book. 

In part 1 we have looked first at an overview of Bible translation, How to observe and read the biblical text carefully, and then we move on to more complex and longer units of text.

In part 2 we spend time discussing contexts, both theirs(the ancient audience) and ours(the modern readers). Historical and cultural context, issue of preunderstanding, literary context, word studies.

In part 3 focuses on the theory needed to identify and construct the principlizing bridge, to cross over the river of differences, and to grasp the meaning of the text in a way that changes our lives in the world today. Deals with what meaning is and who controls it(author or reader), theological principle and concept of meaning, role of the Holy Spirit in this whole interpretive process, helping us to move on from head knowledge to actual life-changing behavior.

In part 4 we focus on how to take the Interpretive Journey within the New Testament. How to take the Journey with passages from different types or genres of New Testament literature. Cover, respectively, New Testament Letters, the Gospels, Acts, and Revelation. Teaching you how to apply your new skills to the New Testament.

In part 5 addresses some of the specific challenges and opportunities of interpreting and applying the Old Testament. We refine the steps of the journey to fit the Old Testament situation more closely. How to take the Imterpretive Journey with passages from the different types of Old Testament genres. Sharpen your tools for grasping passages from the entire range of Old Testament literature: narrative, law, poetry, prophetic literature, and wisdom literature.
