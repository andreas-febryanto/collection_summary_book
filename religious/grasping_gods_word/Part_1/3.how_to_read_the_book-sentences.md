# How To Read The Book - Sentences

---

If someone invited you over for dinner, what would your expectations be regarding the meal? What kind of meal would you be anticipating? We, personally, are easily satisfied. Give us a nice steak and potato with all the trimmings.

What about you? What would you expect at a meal? How would you react if your expectations were not met at all? For example, what if you showed up at some friends’ house and they served you nice, soft, mushy baby food? There are some really great flavors of baby food that are available strained peas, stewed prunes good stuff, if you are six months old. However, since you are not six months old, you expect something more substantial something you can sink your teeth into. Baby food would be a disappointment (and perhaps put a strain on your friendship!).

Bible study is much the same. Plunging into the Word of God is similar to sitting down at a meal. We expect to eat something nourishing, something substantial, and something appropriate to our maturity level. We want to dig into the real meat. But often we are able only to come up with baby food. 

If you desire to pull out of God’s Word some of the serious “meat” that he has placed there for us to sink our teeth into It takes work hard work! And you, the reader, have to decide whether you are content with shallow “baby food” that comes from casual reading or whether you want to work for the “mature food” that comes from serious reading.

## Serious Reading and Love Letters

###### How to Read a Love Letter(or email)

In April Kevin and Whitney moved beyond being “just friends” and went out on their first real date. By mid-May Kevin was thinking that “this could be love.” In June, however, before the young couple had said anything specific to each other about the relationship, Whitney travelled to Ghana with other members of their church on a two-month mission trip to an isolated rural area that did not have any email or phone service. Two weeks went by and Kevin didn’t hear anything from Whitney. Finally the team visited a city that had internet service and the anxious Kevin gets the precious email he has been longing for from Whitney.

He may read it three or four times, but he is just beginning. To read it as accurately as he would like would require several dictionaries and a good deal of close work with a few experts of etymology and philology

However, he will do all right without them. He will ponder over the exact shade of meaning of every word, every comma. The email starts off with “Hi, Kevin.” What, he asks himself, is the exact significance of those words? Did she refrain from saying “Dear Kevin” because she was bashful?

Maybe she would have said “Hi, So-and-so” to anybody! A worried frown now appears on his face. But it disappears as soon as he really gets to thinking about the first sentence. She certainly wouldn’t have written that to anybody!

> This lovesick young man is a good reader because he scrutinizes the text for all the details, even the most minute. One of the most critical skills needed in reading the Bible is the ability to see the details. Most of us read the Bible too quickly, and we skip over the details of the text. However, the meaning of the Bible is intertwined into the details of every sentence. Our first step in grasping a biblical text is to observe as many details as possible. We want to see as much as possible. At this early stage of analysis, try to refrain from interpreting or applying the text.
> 
> So, how do we develop the skill of observing the Bible? There are several basic features to look for that will help us These features include repetition of words, contrasts, comparisons, lists, cause and effects, figures of speech, conjunctions, verbs, and pronouns. This list, however, represents only some of what you might search for. Observation includes looking carefully at all the details of the text.
> 
> Another thing to keep in mind as we begin is that reading and interpreting is a combination of analyzing small pieces of text and big pieces of text. We have to understand the small parts of the text (words, phrases, sentences) in order to understand the larger chunks (paragraphs, chapters, stories). However, the larger units of text also provide a critical context for understanding the small units. So the process requires a bit of both — reading the whole to get a general overview and then analyzing the parts to reveal the nitty-gritty details.

## Things to Look for in Sentences

###### 1. Repetition of Words

Look for words that repeat. First, be sure to note any words that repeat within the sentence you are studying. Then survey the sentences around the text you are reading and look for repetition in the larger passage. example: 2 Corinthians 1:3–7

> Reread the first sentence. How many times does “comfort” occur? Four times! In one sentence! Alarms should go off in your head. You’ve seen the obvious: this passage has something to do with comfort. Is there more? Look back through the rest of that passage. How many times does “comfort” reappear? Is it in every sentence? Is “comfort” used in the same way each time? Where is “comfort” used as a verb and where is it used as a noun? Which modifiers are used with “comfort” and how do they vary (“all comfort,” “the comfort,” “our comfort,” “your comfort”)? Who is being comforted? Who comforts? Also, what about “suffering”? Which verses mention “suffering”? How many times does “suffering” occur? Who is suffering? Is there a connection between suffering and comfort?

###### 2. Contrast

Look for items, ideas, or individuals that are contrasted with each other. example: 1 John 1:5–7

> What is the major contrast in this passage? “Light” and “darkness.” Can we be more specific about the nature of the contrast? Yes. Note that the contrast breaks down into two parts: (1) the nature of God (light and no darkness), and (2) our manner of walking (in light versus in darkness).

###### 3. Comparisons

Contrast focuses on differences. Comparison focuses on similarities. Look for items, ideas, or individuals that are compared with each other. example Proverbs 25:26

> How are the righteous who give way to the wicked like a muddied spring? Because the spring, like the righteous person, was once clean, pure, and useful but now is contaminated and useless for service.

###### 4. Lists

Any time you encounter more than two itemized things, you can identify them as a list. Write the list down and explore its significance. Is there any order? Are the items grouped in any way? example: Galatians 5:19–21

> The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like.

###### 5. Cause and Effect

Often the biblical writers will state a cause and then state the effect of that cause. Example: Romans 12:2

> What is the cause? Our transformation through the renewing of our minds. What is the associated effect? The ability to discern God’s will
> 
> As you can see, cause-and-effect relationships play an extremely important role in the Bible. Always be on the lookout for them.

###### 6. Figure of Speech

Figures of speech are images in which words are used in a sense other than the normal, literal sense.

> God’s Word is not a literal “lamp” to light up a dark trail for us. Rather, it is a figurative lamp that allows us to see our way through life (feet/path) clearly. Note that both “lamp” and “feet/path” are figures of speech.
> 
> As you observe biblical texts, always identify any figures of speech that occur. Try to visualize the figure of speech. Ask yourself: “What image is the author trying to convey with the figure of speech?”
> 
> Figures of speech are powerful literary forms because they paint images to which we can relate emotionally. These can be images of blessing, like that of the eagle in Isaiah 40, but they can also be images of judgment or disgust.

###### 7. Conjuctions

If we imagine the biblical text to be like a brick house, then conjunctions are the mortar that holds the bricks (phrases and sentences) together. One critical aspect of careful reading is to note all of the conjunctions (“and,” “for,” “but,” “therefore,” “since,” “because,” etc.). Our tendency is to skip over them but don’t do it! Without the mortar the bricks fall into a jumbled mess. So always take note of the conjunctions and identify their purpose or function. That is, try to determine what the conjunction connects. Example:

1. "But" -> you might suspect some sort of contrast.
   
   1. Romans 6:23. Indicates a contrast between the wages of sin (death) and the gift of God (eternal life).

2. “Therefore” or “so” usually presents some type of conclusion based on earlier arguments or reasons. When you encounter a “therefore,” look back in the text and determine what the earlier reason was.
   
   1. An easier “therefore” is in Hebrews 12:1:
      
      > The reason for this “therefore” can easily be found in the previous chapter, Hebrews 11. It is easy to find because 12:1 identifies it for us by saying “since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses.” The people in Chapter 11 are the only cloud of witnesses available in the context.
   
   2. A hard-to-find type in Romans 12:1:
      
      > The word “therefore,” which opens Romans 12, connects this verse to the preceding eleven chapters. For eleven chapters Paul has been discussing theology — the wonderful fact of our salvation by grace through faith. In Romans 12 he switches the subject to behavior. How should we act? How should we behave? The word “therefore” in 12:1 connects who we are with what we should do. Our behavior described in Romans 12 (and following) should be a direct consequence of God’s grace in our lives (discussed in chs. 1–11).
   
   3. A not so obvious in Collossians 3:12:
      
      > What does the “therefore” refer back to? Read the previous eleven verses and look for the underlying reason behind verse 12. In the preceding verses Paul tells the Colossians to put on the new self (see especially v. 10). Since they have put on “the new self,” they “therefore” should also put on new virtues — compassion, kindness, and so on.

3. Other conjunctions are important, too. example: 2 TImothy 1:7-8
   
   > Note the conjunctions in verse 7 (“for,” “but,” “and”) and in verse 8 (“so,” “or,” “rather”). Which two things are contrasted by the conjunction “but” in verse 7? How does the “so” in the next sentence relate verse 8 to verse 7? Likewise, what is it that the conjunction “rather” in verse 8 is contrasting?

###### 8. Verbs - Where All the Actions Is

Verbs are important because they communicate the action of the sentence. As you observe the text, be sure to note the verbal action. Try to identify what kind of verb is used. Is the verb a past, present, or future tense verb (I went, I go, I will go)? Does it present a progressive idea; that is, does it have continued action (I was going, I am going, I will be going)? Is it an imperative verb (Go!)?

Be especially sure to note all imperative verbs! These are often God’s commands to us. example: Ephesians 4: 2-3.

Another important distinction to look for in verbs is whether they are active or passive. Active verbs are those in which the subject is doing the action (Bill hit the ball). Passive verbs are those verbs where the subject is acted upon (Bill was hit by the ball). This distinction is particularly important in Paul’s letters, because it often delineates between what we do and what God has done for us. Passive verbs often underscore the things that God has done for us.

example: 

Since, then, you have been raised [passive] with Christ, set [active!] your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. (Col. 3:1)

###### 9. Pronouns

Note all pronouns and be sure to identify the antecedent (to whom or to what the pronoun refers). Who, for example, are the “our” and “us” in Ephesians 1:3?

## Review

- **Repetition of words** – Look for words and phrases that repeat.

- **Contrasts** – Look for ideas, individuals, and/or items that are contrasted with each other. Look for differences.

- **Comparisons** – Look for ideas, individuals, and/or items that are compared with each other. Look also for similarities.

- **Lists** – Note where the text mentions more than two items.

- **Cause and effect** – There may be more than one effect from a single cause mentioned in the text.

- **Figures of speech** – Look for expressions that convey an image, using words in a sense other than the literal sense.

- **Conjunctions** – Notice terms that join units, like “and,” “but,” “for.” Note what they are connecting.

- **Verbs** – Note whether a verb is past, present, or future; active or passive; also look for imperatives.

- **Pronouns** – Identify the antecedent for each pronoun.

## Conclusion

The first step in tackling a biblical text is to make as many detailed observations as possible. We want to dig deep and to see as much as possible. The above list is far from exhaustive and is presented to help you get started. As you get into a text, observe as many details as possible. Spend time in the passage. Each sentence in the Bible has dozens and dozens of details just waiting for you to observe. Look carefully at the text. Read it over and over! Observe. Write down your observations. Read it again. Look some more. Write some more. Which observations have you missed? There are more yet to find. Don’t quit! Keep digging!
