## The Art of Observation - Learning to See

Learning to see details is a skill that does not come naturally, but it can be developed through practice. The following story is a classic tale about one student’s education in the art of observation.

> ###### The Student, the Fish, and Agassiz
> 
> ###### By the Student
> 
> It was more than fifteen years ago that I entered the laboratory of Professor Agassiz, and told him I had enrolled my name in the scientific school as a student of natural history. He asked me a few questions about my object in coming, the mode in which I afterwards proposed to use the knowledge I might acquire and finally, whether I wished to study any special branch. To the latter I replied that while I wished to be well grounded in all departments of zoology, 
> 
> I purposed to devote myself specially to insects. “When do you wish to begin?” he asked. “Now,” I replied. This seemed to please him, and with an energetic “very well,” he reached from a shelf a huge jar of specimens in yellow alcohol. “Take this fish,” said he, “and look at it; we call it a Haemulon; by and by I will ask what you have seen.”
> 
> With that he left me. In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the professor, who had, however, left the museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dried all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate it from a fainting-fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of a normal, sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was to be done but return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion. Half an hour passed, an hour, another hour; the fish began to look loathsome. I turned it over and around; looked it in the face — ghastly; from behind, beneath, above, sideways, at a three-quarters view — just as ghastly. I was in despair; at an early hour I concluded that lunch was necessary; so with infinite relief, the fish was carefully replaced in the jar, and for an hour I was free.
> 
> On my return, I learned that Professor Agassiz had been at the museum, but had gone and would not return for several hours. Slowly I drew forth that hideous fish, and with a feeling of desperation again looked at it. I might not use a magnifying glass; instruments of all kinds were interdicted. My two hands, my two eyes, and the fish; it seemed a most limited field. I pushed my fingers down its throat to see how sharp its teeth were. I began to count the scales in the different rows until I was convinced that was nonsense. At last a happy thought struck me — I would draw the fish; and now with surprise I began to discover new features in the creature. Just then the professor returned.
> 
> “That is right,” said he, “a pencil is one of the best eyes. I am glad to notice, too, that you keep your specimen wet and your bottle corked.”
> 
> With these encouraging words he added, “Well, what is it like?”
> 
> He listened attentively to my brief rehearsal of the structure of parts whose names were still unknown to me: fringed gill-arches, fleshly lips, lidless eyes; the lateral line, the spinous fin, and the forked tail. When I had finished, he waited as if expecting more, and then, with an air of disappointment:
> 
> “You have not looked very carefully. Why,” he continued, more earnestly, “you haven’t seen one of the most conspicuous features of the animal, which is as plainly before your eyes as the fish itself. Look again; look again!” and he left me to my misery.
> 
> I was mortified. Still more of that wretched fish? But now I set myself to the task with a will, and discovered one new thing after another, until I saw how just the professor’s criticism had been. The afternoon passed quickly, and when towards its close, the professor inquired, “Do you see it yet?”
> 
> “No,” I replied. “I am certain I do not, but see how little I saw before.”
> 
> “That is next best,” said he earnestly, “but I won’t hear you now; put away your fish and go home; perhaps you will be ready with a better answer in the morning. I will examine you before you look at the fish.”
> 
> This was disconcerting; not only must I think of the fish all night, studying without the object before me, what this unknown but most visible feature might be, but also, without reviewing my new discoveries, I must give an exact account of them the next day.
> 
> The cordial greeting from the professor the next morning was reassuring; here was a man who seemed to be quite as anxious as I that I should see for myself what he saw.
> 
> “Do you perhaps mean,” I asked, “that the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs?”
> 
> His thoroughly pleased, “Of course, of course!” repaid the wakeful hours of the previous night. After he had discoursed most happily and enthusiastically — as he always did upon the importance of this point — I ventured to ask what I should do next.
> 
> “Oh, look at your fish!” he said, and left me again to my own devices. In a little more than an hour he returned and heard my new catalogue.
> 
> “That is good, that is good!” he repeated, “but that is not all; go on.” And for three long days, he placed that fish before my eyes, forbidding me to look at anything else, or to use any artificial aid. “Look, look, look,” was his repeated injunction.
> 
> This was the best entomological lesson I ever had — a lesson whose influence has extended to the details of every subsequent study; a legacy the professor has left to me, as he left it to many others, of inestimable value, which we could not buy, with which we cannot part.



Do you see similarities between studying God’s Word and studying fish? Read the Bible carefully. Look for the items we discussed in chapter 3. Look for other details as well. **Observe! Look some more. Observe some more. Look again. Ask questions of the text. Look again. See more. Dig! Make notes.** Mark the observations you see. Reread the passage. Look for other details. There is more! Keep digging! You get the idea. God is speaking here and you want to hear him correctly.

## Things to Look for in Paragraphs

#### 1. General and Specific

Sometimes an author will introduce an idea with a general statement — that is, an overview or summary of the main idea. The author will then follow this general statement with the specifics of the idea. Often these specifics provide the supporting details that make the general idea true or explain it more completely. For example, I can make a **general statement**, “I like dessert.” I can then explain this more fully with the
**specific details**, “I like apple pie, strawberry shortcake, chocolate ice cream, and cheesecake.” This is a movement from **general to specific**. example:

> General statement: Paul makes a general statement in Galatians 5:16 `Walk by the Spirit and gratify the desires of the flesh`.
> 
> Specific details: Paul presents the specifics of `gratifying the desires of the flesh`
> 
> Then he moves on to the specifics `walk by the spirit` in 5:22-23
> 
> **another example**
> 
> General statements: Romans 12: 1
> 
> Specific details: Romans 12: 9-13; and continue on into chapter 15.

Also keep in mind that the authors will frequently **reverse the order** and go from **specific to general**. The writer will first list the *specifics* (“I like apple pie, strawberry shortcake, chocolate ice cream, and cheesecake”) and then recap the idea with a *general* statement summarizing the main point (“I like dessert”). example: Love

> Specific: 1 Corinthians 13: 1-12
> 
> General: Summarize main point 1 Corinthians 13: 13

#### 2. Questions and Answers

Occasionally an author will raise a rhetorical question and then answer that question. Example: Romans 6:1 then Paul answer his own question in verse 2. 3:1, 5, 9, 27–31; 4:1, 9; 6:15; 7:1, 7, 13; 8:31–35; 11:1, 7, 11.

This technique is not limited to Paul’s letters. Mark uses the question-and-answer format in several places as the backdrop for the story of Jesus. Example Mark 2: 1-3: 6

The first four questions are raised by opponents of Jesus. The Pharisees and others are challenging the religious behavior of Jesus and his disciples. In the verses that follow each question, Jesus answers the inquiry with a clear justification of his actions.

The fifth question, however, is asked by Jesus and is directed at the Pharisees. The answer to his question is obvious, for the lawful thing is to “do good,” as Jesus does by healing the man’s shriveled hand, and not to “do evil” and “to kill” as the Pharisees are plotting to do to Jesus (3:6). However, even though Jesus has answered their questions, they fail to answer his.

#### 3. Dialogue

Dialogue, of course, overlaps with the question-and-answer feature discussed above. The four questions in Mark 2:15–3:6 are part of an ongoing dialogue between Jesus and the Pharisees. Dialogue may seem at first glance to be too obvious to worry about. Clearly, in narrative material dialogue is employed frequently and is easy to spot. But do not simply read past the point of the dialogue. Note the fact that a dialogue is taking place.

> Then ask questions of the dialogue. Who are the participants? Who is speaking to whom? What is the setting? Are other people around? Are they listening? Are they participating in the dialogue? Is the dialogue an argument? A discussion? A lecture? Friendly chitchat? What is the point of the dialogue? You may find it helpful to color-code the dialogue. `Assign one specific color to each participant and then color the conversation accordingly`.

Example: John 4; John 13: 6-10; Numbers 22;

Some dialogues, however, are not as easy to spot. **These “less- than-obvious” dialogues, however, are often important to the meaning of the passage**. Example the book of Habakkuk. 1:1-4  Habakkuk asks God why he allows injustice to continue in Judah without doing anything to stop it. God answers in 1: 5-11 by promising to send the Babylonians to invade Judah and to destroy the nation. Habakuk objects in 1: 12-2:1 because an invasion is not quite what *Habakuk had in mind*. Nonetheless, God answers the objection in 2: 2-20 by stating that the *invasion is inevitable*. Once you recognize the dialogue format of Habakkuk, the message of the book becomes clear.

#### 4. Purpose/Result Statements

 These are phrases or sentences that describe the reason, the result, or the consequence of some action. They are frequently introduced by **result-oriented conjunctions** such as “that,” “in order that,” and “so that,” but they can also be introduced with the simple infinitive.

Example: Eph 2:10; John 3:16; John 15:16; Deut 6:3; Ps 119:11.

#### 5. Means (By Which Something Is Accomplished)

When an action, a result, or a purpose is stated, look for the **means that brings about that action, result, or purpose**. How is the action or result brought into reality? How is the purpose accomplished?

> Example: Romans 8: 13. The `means` by which the misdeeds of the body are put to death is `the Spirit`.
> 
> More examples: Psalm 119: 9. The purpose or action desired is for a young person to stay on the path of purity. What is the `means`? Living according to God's Word.

#### 6. Conditional Clauses

Identify all conditional clauses. These are clauses that present the conditions whereby some action, consequence, reality, or result will happen. The conditional aspect will usually be introduced by the conditional conjunction `if`. The resultant action or consequence will occasionally be introduced by `then`, but often the resultant action or consequence has no specific introductory words. **Whenever you encounter a conditional clause, always determine exactly what the required conditional action is (the if part) and what the result or consequence is (the then part)**.

> Example: 1 John 1:6
> 
> Condition: If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in darkness.
> 
> Result/Consequence: We lie and do not live out the truth.
> 
> Example: Deut 28:1
> 
> Condition: if you fully obey the LORD your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today.
> 
> Result/Consequence: The LORD your God will set you high above all the nations on earth

#### 7. The Actions/Roles of People and the Actions/Roles of God

 Identify these and mark them as separate. Ask the questions: What does God (further identify as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit) do in this passage? What do people do in this passage? Then ask whether there is any kind of connection between what God does and what people do. Example: Ephesians 5:1-2

We are told to be imitators of God in the same way children are *imitators*. We are also told to live a life of love as Christ did. What is Christ’s or God’s role in this passage? Christ’s role was to *offer himself up to God for us*; God’s role is to be the *one who is imitated*.

> In addition, be sure to observe when references to God are made in relational terms (father, husband, king). For example, in Matthew 5:43–6:34 there are fourteen references to God as “Father” (5:45, 48; 6:1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 18, 26, 32). By his repeated use of “Father” in this passage (from the Sermon on the Mount) Jesus is clearly trying to convey an idea of relationship to God as a Father (both his and ours).

#### 8. Emotional Terms

The Bible is not a book of abstract, technical information. It is a book about **relationships**, primarily relationships between **God and people**. Emotions play a big role in relationships. **This is frequently overlooked in biblical interpretation**.

As part of your careful reading, when you observe the text, be sure to underscore words and phrases that have emotional overtones that is, words that convey feeling and emotion. Also be sure to note words such as “father,” “mother,” “child,” “daughter,” “son,” and the like. These usually have underlying emotional connotations as well.

Example: Galatians 4:12-16. `Plead` is much more emotional than `ask`” isn’t it? Paul seems to have intentionally chosen strong emotional terms to express himself in this passage (and throughout Galatians). What feelings does Paul express here? Why does he bring up their past relationship, recalling how they once welcomed him? How strong is the phrase `Torn out your eyes`? Likewise, what kind of connotations does the word `enemy` carry?

The Old Testament uses emotional terminology even more frequently than the New Testament. Example: Jeremiah 3:19-20.

#### 9. Tone

This will often be closely related to the identification of emotional terms. However, once you have noted any emotional terms, continue on to determine the overall tone of the passage. **Is The Bible is not a book of abstract, technical information.** **It is a book about relationships, primarily relationships between God and people.** it one of anger? A scolding tone? A sorrowful tone? Or a tone of unimpassioned explanation?

Example: Contrast tone of Collosians 3: 1-4 with that of Galatians 3: 1-4

In Colossians 3:1–4 Paul is using a calm, explanatory tone. He does not use strong emotional terms. In Galatians 3:1–4, however, Paul’s tone is quite different. He is chiding or scolding the Galatians. He even sounds as if he may be a little angry or at least disappointed with his readers, or both. His tone is part of his message, however, and it is important to note the tone of each passage you study.

## Review

- **Repetition of words -** Look for words and phrases that repeat.

- **Contrasts -** Look for ideas, individuals, and/or items that are contrasted with each other. Look for differences.

- **Comparisons -** Look for ideas, individuals, and/or items that are compared with each other. Look also for similarities.

- **Lists -** Anytime the text mentions more than two items, identify them as a list.

- **Cause and effect -** Look for cause-and-effect relationships.

- **Figures of speech -** Identify expressions that convey an image, using words in a sense other than the normal literal sense.

- **Conjunctions -** Notice terms that join units, like "and," "but," "for." Note what they are connecting

- **Verbs -** Note whether a verb is a past, present, or future; active or passive; and the like.

- **Pronouns -** Identify the antecedent for each pronoun.

- **Questions and answers -** Note if the text is built on a question-and-answer format.

- **Dialogue -** Note if the text includes dialogue. Identify who is speaking and to whom.

- **Means -** Note if a sentence indicates that something was done by means of someone/something (answers "how?"). Usually you can insert the phrase "by means of" into the sentence.

- **Purpose/result statements -** These are a more specific type of "means," often telling why. Purpose and result are similar and sometimes indistinguishable. In a purpose statement, you usually can insert the phrase "in order that." In a result clause, you usually can insert the phrase "so that."

- **General to specific and specific to general -** FInd the general statements that are followed by specific examples or applications of the general. Also find specific statements that are summarized by a general one.

- **Conditional clauses -** A clause can present the condition by which some action or consequence will result. Often such statements use an "if ... then" framework (although in English the "then" is often left out).

- **Actions/roles of God -** Identify actions or roles that the text ascribes to God.

- **Actions/roles of people -** Identify actions or roles that the tesxt ascribes to people or encourages people to do/be.

- **Emotional terms -** Does the passage use terms that have emotional energy, like kinship words("father," "son") or words like "pleading"?

- **Tone of the passage -** What is the overall tone of the passage: happy, sad, encouraging, and so on ?

## Conclusion

**Keep in mind that we are not trying to interpret the text yet.** The interpretation phase comes later. This first phase — and a critical one — is that of `observing or seeing`. We are merely asking the question, `“What does the text say?”` So, for now, stay in this phase. Try to see all you can.
