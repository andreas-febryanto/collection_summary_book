# PART 2 Contexts -- Now and Then

---

In part 2 we take a closer look at context, the key to determining the meaning of the Bible. We start with the context of the Bible itself. In **Chapter 6 we explore the historical-cultural context, or the background, of the Bible.** We look closely at the world of the Bible to see how God spoke to ancient people living in particular cultures and facing specific situations. Once we understand what God was saying to them, we can understand more clearly what he is saying to us.

We spend time in **Chapter 7 dealing with a context that is often overlooked — our own context as contemporary readers.** What do we bring with us to the text? Here we look at the issue of preunderstanding — all of the ideas and experiences we bring to the task of interpretation. How do we handle our preunderstanding in a way that does not allow it to blind us to what God is trying to say?

In **Chapter 8 we learn how to discern the literary context — the texts that surround the passage we are studying.**

We close this unit by discussing a topic that is closely related to both literary and historical-cultural context. In **Chapter 9 you will learn how to do word studies properly (i.e., in context).** By the end of part 2, you should have a pretty good feel for the importance of context, both ours and that of the biblical writers.
