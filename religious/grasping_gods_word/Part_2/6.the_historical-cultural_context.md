# The Historical-Cultural Context

---

If you had to choose your favorite character in the Bible, some of you might choose the apostle Paul. His passion for serving Jesus Christ continues to challenge us. In our New Testament we have thirteen letters traditionally attributed to Paul. In the last chapter of the last letter he wrote (2 Timothy), Paul verbalizes his feelings about coming to the end of his life: 2 Tim 4:6-8

As Paul concludes the letter, he repeats a simple message to Timothy, his friend and coworker. 4:9; 21. We can tell that Paul wants Timothy to come visit him, but **only an understanding of the historical-cultural context lying behind these words can reveal the depth and emotion of Paul’s plea.**

> Most evangelical scholars believe Timothy is ministering in Ephesus while Paul is imprisoned in Rome. They are hundreds of miles apart. Travel by ship was considered dangerous from mid September through the end of May and was completely closed down from early November to around early March. Both Paul and Timothy know this, of course. If Paul sent the letter of 2 Timothy by Tychicus in the summer, Timothy probably has little time to make the long journey to Rome. The historical background of this passage helps us see what Paul is really saying to his young friend: “Put things in order in Ephesus and get on a ship as soon as you can. If you don’t leave now before winter sets in, the shipping lanes will shut down and you won’t arrive in time. Timothy, do your best to get here before they put me to death. Come quickly, my friend, before it’s too late.” Knowing the historical-cultural context of this passage makes it come alive with emotion and intensity. **Paul is not merely asking Timothy to come visit. He is more like a father pleading for his son to come to him before he dies.**

To grasp God’s Word we must understand the meaning of the text in context and apply that meaning to our lives. **Context takes two major forms: literary context and historical-cultural context (commonly referred to as “background”).**

Why do we need to bother with studying the historical-cultural background of a passage? Is it really important? What exactly is involved in studying historical-cultural context? Are there any pitfalls along the way? What tools are available to help us get the job done? Our goal in this chapter is to show you how to study the historical-cultural context of a passage and to persuade you that knowing the background of a text can help clarify its meaning and reveal its relevance to your life.

## Why Bother with Historical-Cultural Context?

In his commentary on the background of the Bible, Craig Keener reminds us that God did not dictate most of the Bible in the first person. **He did not say, “Because I’m God I will speak directly to everybody in all times and cultures.”** Instead, **God (the ultimate source) spoke through the human writers of Scripture (the immediate source) to address the real-life needs of people at a particular time in a particular culture. This is how God chose to speak.**

Please don’t misunderstand what we are saying here. **God has given us eternal principles in his Word that apply to every person of every age in every culture.** Our goal in Grasping God’s Word is to teach you how to discover and live out those theological principles. We are not questioning whether God has given us eternally relevant principles; we are simply noting how he has done so. We believe that the way we approach the Bible (i.e., the way we listen to God) should match how God gave us the Bible (i.e., the way God chose to speak). Otherwise, we will likely misunderstand what God is trying to say to us.

Since God spoke his message in specific, historical situations (i.e., to people living in particular places, speaking particular languages, adopting a particular way of life), we should take the ancient historical-cultural situation seriously. The bottom line is that we cannot simply ignore “those people living back then” and jump directly to what God wants to say to us. Why not? Again, because the way we listen to God (our interpretive approach) must honor the way God chose to communicate. **We should not be so arrogant and prideful as to think that God cared nothing about the original audience but was merely using them to get a message to us.**

The truth of the matter is that each passage of Scripture was “God’s Word to other people before it became God’s Word to us.” **God cared deeply about the original hearers and spoke to them within their own historical-cultural situation. God also cares deeply about us and wants to speak to us. The time-bound message of Scripture contains eternally relevant principles that we can discover and live out.**

Think again about how the Interpretive Journey moves from the meaning of the text for the biblical audience across the river of differences (e.g., time, place, culture, situation) by means of the principlizing bridge to the application of those theological principles in our lives.

.**Back to our question: Why bother to become familiar with the original historical-cultural context? We do so because it offers us a window into what God was saying to the biblical audience. Since we live in a very different context, we must recapture God’s original intended meaning as reflected in the text and framed by the ancient historical-cultural context** Once we understand the meaning of the text in its original context, we can apply it to our lives in ways that will be just as relevant. God’s Word is eternally relevant. Our task as students of his Word is to discover that relevance by doing our contextual homework.

**This leads us to a crucial interpretive principle: For our interpretation of any biblical text to be valid, it must be consistent with the historical-cultural context of that text. If our interpretation would not have made sense back then, we are probably on the wrong track.** Fee and Stuart rightly emphasize that “the true meaning of the biblical text for us is what God originally intended it to mean when it was first spoken.” **We must first determine what a text meant “in their town” before we can determine what it means and how we should apply that meaning to our own time and culture.** Our goal, then, is to understand the historical-cultural context of the biblical passage as clearly as possible in order to grasp the meaning of the passage.

## What Is Historical-Cultural Context?

What exactly do we mean by historical-cultural context? Generally speaking, this kind of context involves the biblical writer, the biblical audience, and any historical-cultural elements touched on by the passage itself. **Historical-cultural context relates to just about anything outside the text that will help you understand the text itself** (e.g., what life was like for the Israelites as they wandered in the desert, what the Pharisees believed about the Sabbath, where Paul was when he wrote Philippians). **Literary context, as we will see in chapter 8, relates to the context within the book** (e.g., the form a passage takes, the flow of argument within the book, and the meaning of the words and sentences that surround the passage you are studying).

#### The Biblical Writer

**Because God chose to work through human authors as the immediate source of his inspired Word, the more we know about the human author the better. Try to find out as much as you can about the writer’s background.**

> When studying one of Paul’s letters, for example, it is helpful to know that before the Lord radically changed his life, he used to get papers from the Jewish high priest authorizing him to imprison Christians. He persecuted the church out of a misdirected zeal to serve God. This explains why the early Christians feared Paul for a time even after his conversion: “All those who heard him [preach] were astonished and asked, ‘Isn’t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?’ ” (Acts 9:21). This also helps us understand why Paul describes himself as “the worst of sinners” in 1 Timothy 1:16. **We don’t often think of Paul, a man whom God used to change the world, as struggling with horrible memories of the things he did before he met Christ. Paul’s life is certainly a portrait of God’s grace.**

Along with knowing something about the author’s background, you may also ask: **When did he write and what kind of ministry did he have? While we are talking about eighth-century BC prophets**, do you remember Hosea’s infamous wife, Gomer? Have you thought about how Hosea’s marriage was linked to his ministry? His heartbreaking marriage to Gomer became a vehicle for understanding and expressing the spiritual adultery of Israel against God. Just as Gomer had rejected Hosea, so Israel had rejected her true God, Yahweh, for pagan gods.

Along with knowing about the writer’s background and ministry, **you will also want to understand more about the specific relationship between the writer and the people he was addressing.** What kind of relationship did Jonah have with his primary audience, the Ninevites? About the same time that Amos and Hosea were warning Israel of God’s judgment soon to occur at the hands of the ominous Assyrians, Jonah was sent to warn Nineveh. What difference does it make to know that Nineveh is the capital city of Assyria? It helps to see that at the heart of the story lies Jonah’s contempt for the Ninevites (Assyrians) and his fear that God might act with compassion toward his enemies. God doesn’t disappoint him.

**Perhaps the most important thing to know about the biblical writers is why they are writing.** Why does the author of 1 and 2 Chronicles, for example, repeat much of Samuel and Kings? The answer lies in the writer’s purpose. The Chronicler (perhaps Ezra) is writing for Israel after the exile (i.e., for the restored community). He is trying to show that God is still very much interested in his people after judging them by the exile. For example, the Chronicler seems to idealize David and Solomon by omitting anything that might tarnish their image (e.g., David’s sin with Bathsheba). In this way the writer reassures his audience that although God has judged his people, he still loves them and wants to use them to accomplish his purposes.

> Let’s review. When we think about historical-cultural context, we\first need to consider the biblical writer. What is the writer’s background? Where does he come from? When does he write? What kind of ministry does he have? What is his relationship with the people he addresses? Finally, why is he writing? Answers to these kinds of questions will give you insight into the circumstances of the biblical writer and clarify the meaning of what he has written.

#### The Biblical Audience

**Discovering the historical-cultural context also involves knowing something about the biblical audience and their circumstances.** Take Mark’s gospel as an example. Mark makes a point of emphasizing the cross of Christ and the demands of discipleship throughout his gospel. Many scholars believe that Mark’s original audience was the church in the vicinity of Rome and that Mark was preparing them for the persecution they would soon face at the hands of Emperor Nero during the mid-60s AD. To encourage these believers to remain faithful in the midst of suffering, Mark stresses how Jesus remained faithful during his time of suffering.

When you read the Old Testament prophets, you need to know something of the general circumstances of the biblical audience in order to make sense of the prophetic message. When studying Jeremiah, for example, it helps to know that his prophetic ministry began about 627 BC and ended a short time after 586 BC. This means that Jeremiah witnessed the revival under King Josiah, the fall of Assyria, the rise of Babylon, the first siege of Jerusalem (598/597 BC), and the destruction of his nation in 587/586 BC. Jeremiah preached against the sins of Judah and predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile.

Yet Jeremiah also spoke powerful words of encouragement and hope during the dark days of the final siege of Jerusalem. Note Jeremiah 29:11: “ ‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’ ” These words form part of a letter that Jeremiah wrote to people already experiencing God’s discipline — the exiles of 597 BC. *The historical context of this verse will surely influence how we understand its meaning. In spite of the devastating consequences of Judah’s disobedience, God’s final word is not judgment but hope. Nevertheless, even though God’s deliverance is certain, it will not be immediate (see 29:10).*

Most, if not all, **New Testament letters are situational or occasional, meaning that they were written to address specific situations faced by the churches.** Colossians, for example, is written to a group of believers battling a false teaching that gave Christ a place, but not the supreme place that is rightfully his (Col. 2:4–5, 8, 16–23) Paul writes to refute this false teaching by emphasizing the absolute supremacy of Christ (1:15–20; 2:9–15).

In a similar fashion, John wrote his first letter to Christians wrestling with what many scholars believe was an early form of Gnosticism. Central to this heresy was the belief that spirit is entirely good and matter is entirely evil. You can probably guess some of the implications of this line of thinking: Christ wasn’t a real human being; a person could either treat their material body harshly or indulge it; salvation meant escape from the body and was accomplished by means of a special knowledge (gnōsis is the Greek word translated “knowledge”). *In the case of 1 John, knowing the historical-cultural context will clarify the main themes of the letter: the genuine incarnation of Christ (i.e., God really did become a human being), the need to walk in the light rather than in immorality, and the need for love (vs. the arrogance of those who claimed to possess the special knowledge).*

#### Other Historical-Cultural Elements

Sometimes it is difficult to know much about the biblical author and the audience or their specific circumstances. Often you will focus more on the historical, social, geographical, religious, political, and economic elements that shape your passage.

Sometimes knowing more about the geography or topography assumed by the text can help you grasp its meaning. Jesus starts his parable of the good Samaritan with the statement: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho” (Luke 10:30). You would certainly go down from Jerusalem to Jericho, descending from about 2,500 feet above sea level to about 800 feet below sea level. In addition, the trip would not be a walk in the park. **The distance is almost twenty miles and would take you through some rugged desert country that offered plenty of hiding places for thieves. Knowing the geography helps us understand how easy it would have been to pass by the dying man and how troublesome it would have been to be a loving neighbor.**

**One of the most productive areas of background study relates to social customs**. If you are studying Ephesians 5:21–6:9, for example, you need to know something about Greco-Roman household codes in order to make sense of your passage. These rules were developed primarily to instruct the head of the household about how to deal with members of his family. The apostle Paul uses the household code concept, but he transforms it in powerful ways. **For instance, Greco-Roman codes told husbands to make their wives submit, but they never listed love as a duty of the husband. In Ephesians 5:25 Paul breaks the mold when he instructs husbands to “love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.” Paul’s exhortation for all members of the household to “submit to one another out of reverence for Christ” (5:21) would have been even more radical.**

**Often in the Scriptures social customs are loaded with religious significance.** In the parable of the prodigal son, we think nothing of the father running to greet his returning son. **But when we learn that elderly Jewish men were considered much too dignified to run, we begin to see that Jesus is telling us how God feels about and responds to sinners when they come home.**  If you have ever been in the far country spiritually, you’ll be glad to know that when you decide to return home, God stands ready to “ditch his dignity” and run to meet you.

**Sometimes your passage will touch on economic issues.** On his second missionary tour (Acts 15:39–18:22), Paul plants a church at Philippi. There Paul and Silas meet a slave girl who has a spirit by which she predicts the future. She continues to bother the missionary team until Paul finally commands the spirit to come out of her. Her enraged owners then drag Paul and Silas into the marketplace, where the magistrates order them to be stripped, beaten, and later imprisoned for causing trouble. All this happens because the demon-possessed slave girl has been earning a lot of money for her owners. When the spirit left the girl, the money left the owners’ pockets, and they take their revenge on the missionaries.

**You also need to pay attention to political issues that may surface in your passage.** Acts 16, Since it was illegal to publicly beat and imprison a Roman citizen, especially without a trial, the Roman officials act quickly to apologize for their actions. Paul and Silas probably demand an escort out of town in order to make a public statement about their innocence for the benefit of the church in Philippi.

## Dangers Associated With Studying Background

**While the greatest danger is ignoring the historical-cultural context, there are also dangers associated with studying it. To begin with, you need to watch out for inaccurate background information.** Example: Matthew 19: 23-24

The problem with this explanation is that there is no evidence for this kind of gate. The “eye of a needle” meant essentially what it means today (i.e., the eye of a sewing needle). **Jesus is using the largest animal in Palestine and one of the smallest openings to make a forceful statement about how hard it is for the rich and powerful to enter God’s kingdom.**

> This is just one example of how inaccurate information can get passed down through generations of preachers and teachers. Just because background material makes a great sermon illustration does not mean it is accurate. Your information will only be as good as your resources, and not all resources are created equal.

**A second danger associated with studying historical-cultural context is that of elevating the background of the text above the meaning of the text.** Example: Luke 18:9-14

For instance, you may be tempted to spend all your time learning about Pharisees and tax collectors. You certainly need to know something about these two groups and their role and reputation in Jesus’ day. **Yet you don’t want to let your fascination with background information cause you to miss the point — God judges the proud and exalts the humble.**

> Keep in mind as you study historical-cultural context that there is a difference between the context of the passage and the meaning of the passage. We study background not to lose ourselves in a maze of historical trivia, but to grasp the meaning of the passage more clearly.

**Finally, we caution you not to let yourself slowly evolve into nothing more than a walking database of ancient facts. Don’t lose your interpretive heart in your quest for information to deepen your understanding of the text. Keep your study of the background of the Bible in proper perspective. We study the historical-cultural context not as an end in itself, but as a tool to help us grasp and apply the meaning of the biblical text.**

**In spite of these three dangers, however, the greatest danger by far is assuming that we do not need to know any background information to understand the Bible.**

## Tools for Identifying Historical-Cultural Context

To identify the historical-cultural context you need to **(1) grasp the historical-cultural context of the book that contains your passage** and **(2) recognize the specific historical-cultural context of the passage itself.**

#### Historical-Cultural Context of the Entire Book

Grasping the historical-cultural context of the entire book means finding out about the biblical author and audience as well as the general setting for the book. The following questions will help you get started:

- Who was the author?

- What was his background?

- When did he write?

- What was the nature of his ministry?

- What kind of relationship did he have with the audience?

- Why was he writing?

- Who was the biblical audience?

- What were their circumstances?

- How was their relationship to God?

- What kind of relationship did they have with each other?

- What was happening at the time the book was written?

- Are there any other historical-cultural factors that might shed light on the book?

To understand the historical-cultural context of the entire book, we suggest you consult Bible handbooks, introductions and surveys of the Old and New Testaments, and especially good commentaries.

#### Bible Handbooks

Bible handbooks usually begin with general articles about the Bible and the world of the Bible (e.g., the nature of Scripture, life in Bible times). **They normally include a brief introduction to each book of the Bible and an equally brief running commentary on the entire biblical text.** Articles on subjects of interest are interspersed throughout.

#### Old Testament and New Testament Introductions and Surveys

These resources supply detailed background information on each book of the Bible as well as an overview of the book’s contents. **Usually they discuss authorship, date, recipients, situation, purpose, and more.** Generally speaking, introductions offer more technical discussions of the background issues and spend less time on the actual content of the books, while surveys touch on background issues and focus more on content. An example of survey:

- definition of the term “revelation”

- discussion of authorship

- discussion of the two main options for the date of writing

- discussion of the recipients and their situation

- statement of the main theme or purpose of the book

- description of the apocalyptic style of Revelation

- explanation of the four main approaches to Revelation

- summary of specific issues (e.g., rapture, millennium)

- detailed outline of the book

- overview of the contents of the book

- bibliography for further reading

#### Commentaries

In most cases a good commentary will be your best bet for up-to-date, detailed information about the historical-cultural context of the book that contains your passage. **Because commentaries are always written from a particular point of view and since they differ in quality and scope, it is always a good idea to consult more than one commentary.**

#### Historical-Cultural Context of the Passage Itself

After you have a good sense of the background of the book that contains your passage, you need to identify the historical-cultural context of the passage itself. **This involves examining any elements of history and culture that are connected to or mentioned in the passage (e.g., geography, politics, religion, economics, family life, social customs).** To accomplish this, we recommend using Bible atlases, Bible dictionaries or encyclopedias, commentaries, background commentaries, Old and New Testament histories, and special studies on ancient life and culture.

###### Bible Atlases

If you want to learn more about the people, places, and events mentioned in your passage, take a look at a Bible atlas. You will find colorful maps of the land, pictures of many of the important sites, helpful charts of political and religious leaders, discussions of the various periods of biblical history, and more.

###### Bible Dictionaries and Encylopedias

This is the place to go when you need information about a particular topic mentioned in your passage. For instance, if you want to know more about the garden of Gethsemane, consult a Bible dictionary or encyclopedia. These resources cover a full range of biblical topics and arrange the topics alphabetically.

###### Commentaries

We mention commentaries again because the good ones are also extremely helpful in shedding light on background matters within your passage.

###### Background Commentaries

This relatively new type of commentary focuses not on the meaning of each passage, but on historical-cultural background essential to grasping the meaning. Background commentaries are helpful because they provide a wealth of information conveniently arranged in a verse-by-verse format.

###### Old Testament and New Testament Histories

Histories are most useful when you want detailed background information on particular topics within your passage. An example  1 Peter 4:9

The traveler was not so fortunate in the accommodations for the night as he was in the quality of the roads on which he traveled by day. Not that inns were lacking, but their reputation (in quality and morals) was notorious. The wine was often adulterated (or after the patron was drunk on good wine, bad was substituted), sleeping quarters were filthy and insect and rodent infested, innkeepers were extortionate, thieves were in wait, government spies were listening, and many were nothing more than brothels.... There were some excellent inns in Italy, but they seem to have been the exception. The upper classes avoided the public accommodations and stayed with friends when they traveled. The moral dangers at the inns made hospitality an important virtue in early Christianity.

###### Special Studies in Ancient Life and Culture

These resources provide detailed discussions on selected topics. **They can be helpful when you really want to dig deep on a particular topic.** You can find articles on biblical cities, social life, legal matters, religious practices, warfare, economic life, and a host of other topics. These special studies are similar to Bible dictionaries, but are more narrowly focused.

#### Computer Software and the Internet

We encourage you to take full advantage of computer software packages that include the best resources. Often the convenience and price are hard to beat. But remember that you are after the best tools, not simply the least expensive deal. You can use the bibliography of resources throughout this chapter to evaluate the various electronic resources.

You need to be much more cautious about Internet resources. This is a rapidly changing environment that has not traditionally represented the best in biblical scholarship. **While the Internet is certainly convenient, you don’t always know whether you are getting reliable information.** We recommend that you stick with resources by well-known and respected authors.

---

## Conclusion

We study the historical-cultural background of the Bible because God chose to speak first to ancient peoples living in cultures that are radically different from our own. As we recapture the original context of God’s Word, we will be able to grasp its meaning and apply that meaning to our lives. Remember, a valid interpretation of any text must be consistent with the historical-cultural context of that text.

In this chapter we have talked about the tools you will need to identify the historical-cultural context of a book and a specific passage. Bible handbooks, Old and New Testament introductions or surveys, and commentaries are particularly useful for grasping the historical-cultural context of the book as a whole. We recommend using atlases, dictionaries or encyclopedias, commentaries, background commentaries, Old and New Testament histories, and special studies to discover the historical-cultural context of a particular passage. We strongly encourage you to add some of these tools to your personal library.

**While some may label background studies “boring” and “irrelevant,” we argue the opposite — that knowing the background of a passage can clarify its meaning and heighten our understanding of its relevance.** Does knowing all that Paul means by “come before winter” make his words less relevant or more relevant? Does understanding the significance of God “running” in the parable of the prodigal son make the story less practical or more practical? *We believe that studying the historical-cultural context of a passage is among the most practical things you can do when it comes to Bible study.*
