# The Literary Context

---

Imagine that you are a college student strolling to class one day when a total stranger hits you with a one-liner: “Go for it!” How would you respond?

To unveil the meaning of “go for it,” most of us would probably come back with a few questions of our own. “What exactly do you mean?” or “Go for what?” We would ask questions as part of our search for a context to give meaning to those three little words. Without a context, “go for it” can mean almost anything. Without a context, words become meaningless.

**When it comes to interpreting and applying the Bible, context is crucial.** In fact, we would go so far as to say that the most important principle of biblical interpretation is that context determines meaning. **When we ignore the context, we can twist the Scriptures and “prove” almost anything.** Example: 1 Corinthians 7: 36c & John 13: 27.

The young man sees in the first verse a direct command to get married and in the second a timetable — get married now! God has spoken!

What keeps us from taking this ridiculous example seriously? Context! Apparently the young man did not bother to read the entire context of 1 Corinthians 7:36c, where the apostle Paul gives advice to engaged men in light of the distressing circumstances in Corinth.

In light of the situation, Paul actually says that it’s better not to marry. In the second verse (John 13:27), the phrase “what you are about to do” refers to Judas’s betraying Jesus and has nothing at all to do with marriage. Under the spotlight of context, we see that these two verses give the young man no scriptural basis for proposing marriage. **Not all examples are this ridiculous, of course, but every violation of context is a dangerous matter.**

To understand and apply the Bible, we need to be concerned with the **two major kinds of context: historical and literary.**

- **Historical context**: historical context is the historical-cultural background of a text.

- **Literary context**: Related to the particular form a passage takes(the literary genre) and to the words, sentences, and paragraphs that surround the passage you are studying(the surrounding context).

## What Is Literary Genre ?

The word genre is a French word meaning “form” or “kind.” **When applied to biblical interpretation, the expression literary genre simply refers to the different categories or types of literature found in the Bible.** In the Old Testament you will encounter **narrative, law, poetry, prophecy, and wisdom.** The New Testament forms include **gospel, history, letter, and apocalyptic literature.** Both Old and New Testaments feature a number of subgenres (e.g., parables, riddles, sermons).

> The metaphor that many linguists use to describe literary genre is that of a game. You can think of each genre as a different kind of game complete with its own set of rules. This insightful analogy shows how we as readers have to play by the rules when it comes to recognizing literary genre.

Think for a moment of a European soccer fan attending his first (American) football and basketball games. Unless we understand the rules under which the game is played, what is taking place is bound to be confusing.

**In a similar way, there are different “game” rules involved in the interpretation of the different kinds of biblical literature.** The author has “played his game,” that is, has sought to convey his meaning, under the rules covering the particular literary form he has used. **Unless we know those rules, we will almost certainly misinterpret his meaning.**

> For communication to occur, the reader must be on the same page as the author in terms of genre. When the stranger said “go for it,” you could have responded with questions to clarify the meaning. But how can we clarify the meaning of the ancient authors when they are not around to field our questions? The answer is literary genre. As Vanhoozer puts it, “What writing pulls asunder — author, context, text, reader — genre joins together.” Even though the author and reader cannot have a face-to-face conversation, they meet in the text where they are able to communicate because they subscribe to a common set of rules — the rules of the particular genre.

**In this way, literary genre acts as a kind of covenant of communication, a fixed agreement between author and reader about how to communicate.** In order for us to “keep the covenant,” we must let the author’s choice of genre determine the rules we use to understand his or her words. **To disregard literary genre in the Bible is to violate our covenant with the biblical author and with the Holy Spirit who inspired his message.**

**You run dangerous risks if you confuse a telephone directory with a love letter or mistake a menu for directions to a friend’s house.** Obviously we don’t read menus the same way that we read love letters, or newspapers the same way that we read devotional books. We know this because the various genres evoke certain interpretive expectations on the part of the reader. The genre game determines the rules for interpretation. **Just as we know that the kind of game determines the rules we play by, so we know that each literary genre in the Bible comes with its own set of built-in rules for interpretation. When readers pay attention to those rules, they have a much greater chance of reading the passage as it was intended. Genres shape our expectations about how to approach a particular text.** The form or genre of the text really is connected to the content of the text and, for this reason, we should take literary genre seriously. **The very meaning of the Bible is at stake!**

## What Is Surrounding Context ?

**Surrounding context simply refers to the texts that surround the passage you are studying. You can think of it as the textual world in which your text lives.** This includes the words, sentences, paragraphs, and discourses that come before and after your passage. **The surrounding context of Romans 12:1–2, for instance, includes the first eleven chapters of Romans as well as Romans 12:3 through the end of the book.** In a broader sense, the surrounding context of Romans 12:1–2 is the rest of the books in the New Testament and even the entire Old Testament. These various contexts form circles around your passage.

![8.1.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/8.1.png)

The immediate context circle is closest to the center since it describes what comes immediately before and after your passage. Example: 1 Peter 5:7. The immediate context includes at least verses 5-9.

> We encourage you to give highest priority to the immediate context when determining the meaning of your passage. As the circles of the context diagram illustrate, the closer the circle is to the center, the greater influence it usually has on the meaning of your passage.

A careful look at the immediate context of 1 Peter 5:7 reveals that casting our cares on the Lord is strongly tied to humbling ourselves before him. The immediate context reveals that humbling ourselves before God means that we entrust our concerns and troubles to God because we know that God loves us and will not let us down. Pride says to God, “I can bear this burden by myself,” whereas humility involves casting our cares on our caring God. What a positive definition of humility! And that insight comes from a careful reading of the immediate context.

## Danger of Disregarding Literary Context

**You have probably heard it said that you can make the Bible say anything you want. That is true only if you disregard the literary context.** When you honor the literary context (including the covenant of communication implicit in the genre), you cannot make the Bible say just anything. Cults are famous for Scripture twisting, and most of their misreadings stem from a breach of literary context. **Just because we approach Scripture as evangelical Christians does not make us immune to misinterpretations should we decide to neglect literary context.** There are a number of dangers associated with disregarding literary context.

#### Ignoring the Surrounding Context

The first danger is simply ignoring the surrounding context. **This usually happens when individuals focus on a single verse without paying attention to how the surrounding verses might affect its meaning.** For example, the following verses are quotable favorites. Do you know their contexts?

- “Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me” (Rev. 3:20).

- “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them” (Matt. 18:20).

- “Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart” (2 Tim. 2:22).

Revelation 3:20 is commonly used to describe Jesus’ promise to anyone who might accept him as Savior and Lord; that is, it is seen as an evangelistic promise: “If you will open the door of your heart, Christ promises to enter.” But in context, Revelation 3:20 is a promise from the risen Christ to a congregation of “lukewarm” Christians. This verse applies directly to Christians living out of fellowship with Christ. As a believer, have you ever strayed so far from Christ that you wondered if he would ever take you back? Revelation 3:20 promises that he loves you and is waiting to restore you if you will repent.

Matthew 18:20 is commonly quoted to remind everyone that group prayer is especially effective. Jesus is saying that if congregations (even small ones with only a few believers) follow God’s guidelines for corporate discipline, they will have his blessings.

Second Timothy 2:22 is a favorite verse for fighting off sexual temptation. Likewise, 2:23–26 speaks of false teaching. In verse 22 Paul tells Timothy to run away from foolish discussions, arguments, and theological novelties so attractive to young ministers (i.e., “evil desires of youth”) and to run instead after righteousness, faith, love, and peace with the true people of God. Much to the surprise of some, this verse has little (if anything) to do with sexual temptation.

> The way our Bibles have
> been divided into chapters and verses doesn’t help matters much. The chapter and verse numbers help us find passages quickly, but they can also lead us to believe that each verse stands alone as an independent unit of thought, like a number in a phone book.6 Just because we attach numbers to the sentences in a paragraph doesn’t mean that we can rip one particular sentence out of its context and disconnect it from what precedes or follows.
> 
> We also need to remember that the chapter and verse divisions are not part of the original documents, but were added much later. When we speak of the Holy Spirit’s inspiring the Scriptures, we are talking about the text itself, not about the reference numbers. Don’t let these later editorial additions cause you to lift individual sentences out of their surrounding context and give them a meaning never intended by their authors.

#### Topical Preaching

> Topical preaching is a valid approach to preaching when the various passages are understood in context and the overall message doesn’t violate those individual contexts. But far too often topical preaching distorts the meaning of Scripture by disregarding the literary context. Here is how that happens.

![8.2.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/8.2.png)

Topical preaching, by contrast, often jumps from one passage to another by stringing together a series of originally unrelated thoughts (see the resulting diagram below).

![8.3.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/8.3.png)

You can see how this approach could easily violate the literary context and lead to all sorts of unbiblical conclusions. Quoting Bible passages out of context may make for an entertaining sermon, but it will mask God’s true message. Misreading the Bible ultimately hurts people by enslaving them rather than setting them free with truth.

## How to Identify the Surrounding Context

Dissecting a text is a pretty good place to enter the world of biblical interpretation, but it is by no means the final stopping place. The Bible is more than a collection of unrelated parts.

**The Holy Spirit moved the biblical writers to connect their words, sentences, and paragraphs into a literary whole in the normal way that people use language to communicate.** Just imagine how a document would appear if the sentences were not linked together to form a unified message.

**We typically don’t string together randomly selected ideas when we are trying to communicate. Normally, sentences build on previous sentences and lead into later sentences to produce a coherent message.** As God’s communication to us, the parts of the Bible connect to form a whole, while the whole in turn provides guidelines or boundaries for understanding the parts. Our understanding of a specific text will always be shaped by the overall message of the book. **If a reader fails to take into account what the author has already said or is about to say, he or she is in danger of missing the point of the passage.**

When we ask you to identify the surrounding context, we are asking you to see how these sentences (the parts) fit together in a book to communicate the larger message (the whole). **We cannot read the author’s mind, but we can trace his thought as it flows through each sentence and paragraph to form the whole book. We want to see how the smaller units connect to form the larger units. This will allow us to interpret our specific passage in light of its place in a larger section (i.e., in its original literary context).**

Knowing the surrounding context will answer questions such as:

- What is this unit’s role or function or purpose in the book?

- What would happen if we removed this section from the book?

- Why did the author include this section as a crucial part of the whole?

> Moreover, it is safe to say that the most accurate interpretation of a passage is the one that best fits that passage’s surrounding context (i.e., one that best accounts for how the smaller sections fit into the larger sections). When our interpretation contradicts literary context (including literary genre and surrounding context), we violate the way people normally use language to communicate and our interpretation is not valid.

Suppose that you have been assigned Philemon 4–7 for your exegetical paper

As you read the passage you ask: Why did Paul say this about Philemon? Is he just praying for Philemon as we would pray for a friend, or is there more to it? Does Paul thank God for Philemon simply because Philemon is a highly respected spiritual leader? Obviously Paul is praising Philemon for something. Why the glowing description?

You won’t really know such answers to these questions until you know the surrounding context. To grasp what Paul really means in verses 4–7, you need to examine what Paul says before and after this passage. This is what we mean by “surrounding context”—how a section fits with what comes before and after it. If you don’t know the surrounding context of your passage, you will probably just skim the surface and miss the real meaning. You need to discover the surrounding context of verses 4–7 in order to grasp Paul’s message in that section. Remember, context determines meaning!

> Finding the surrounding context of any passage consists of three steps. 
> 
> 1. Identify how the book is divided into paragraphs or sections.
> 
> 2. Summarize the main idea of each section.
> 
> 3. Explain how your particular passage relates to the surrounding sections. Let’s continue with our Philemon example.

1. ###### Identify how the book is divided into paragraphs or sections.
   
   Look at several different Bible translations to see how the translators have divided the book and the chapters into smaller units.
   
   | NIV   | KJV  | NASB  | NRSV  | ESV   |
   | ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
   | 1-3   | 1-3  | 1-3   | 1-3   | 1-3   |
   | 4-7   | 4-7  | 4-7   | 4-7   | 4-7   |
   | 8-11  | 8-25 | 8-16  | 8-16  | 8-16  |
   | 12-16 |      | 17-20 | 17-21 | 17-20 |
   | 17-21 |      | 21    | 22    | 21-22 |
   | 22    |      | 22    | 23-25 | 23-25 |
   | 23-25 |      | 23-24 |       |       |
   |       |      | 25    |       |       |
   
   As you can tell, there is some agreement about how the book should be divided, but the translations are certainly not all uniform. **Remember that editorial decisions such as dividing the book into units are intended to help the reader, but they are not inspired. If you want to do the work yourself, you need to look for changes in the text as clues to a shift in the author’s flow of thought.** Items thatmark changes or transitions include the following:
   
   - conjunctions (e.g., therefore, then, but)
   
   - change of genre (e.g., from a greeting to a prayer)
   
   - changes of topic or theme (main idea)
   
   - changes in time, location, or setting
   
   - grammatical changes (e.g., subject, object, pronouns, verb tense, person, or number)
   
   There is a change in topic between verses 3 and 4 as Paul switches from a greeting to a prayer. Don’t miss the conjunction “therefore” in verse 8 and the “so” in verse 17, both beginning new sections. You will also find other change markers in last few verses of the book: “one thing more” (v. 22), change to a greeting (v. 23), a final blessing (v. 25).
   
   In our example, all the translations agree that verses 4–7 form a section and most agree that verses 8–16 constitute another section. Although the translations will rarely agree 100 percent on how to divide the book, make some tentative decisions and move on to step 2 Writing the summaries in step 2 is one way of checking the validity of your section divisions in step 1.

2. ###### Summarize the main idea of each sections in about a dozen words or less.
   
   **For each summary statement that you write, make sure that you summarize the point of the whole section and not just a portion of the section.** After writing a summary, you might want to read the section again and see if your summary truly captures the entire section. When writing your summary, think about two things: 
   
   - The topic or main idea of the section, and
   
   - What the author says about the topic or main idea. 
   
   As you do this, you will have to resist the temptation to get lost in all the details. Stick with the main point, the big idea.
   
   Take a look at our summaries for each section of Philemon:
   
   - vv. 1–3: Paul identifies the letter senders/recipients and offers a greeting.
   
   - vv. 4–7: Paul thanks God for Philemon’s faith and love and intercedes for him.
   
   - vv. 8–16: Paul appeals to Philemon for his “son” Onesimus and offers Philemon perspective on God’s providence in the matter.
   
   - vv. 17–20: Paul urges Philemon to receive Onesimus as he would receive Paul himself.
   
   - v. 21: Paul expresses confidence that Philemon will do even more than he asks.
   
   - v. 22: Paul shares his hope to come in person and visit
     Philemon.
   
   - vv. 23–24: Paul shares greetings from his fellow workers.
   
   - v. 25: Paul closes the letter with a benediction of grace.
   
   Don’t be afraid to reconfigure the units as you try to summarize the main point of each.

3. ###### Explain how your particular passage relates to the surrounding sections.
   
   We tell our students, “If you do nothing else besides read what comes before and what comes after your passage, you will eliminate about 75 percent of all interpretive mistakes.” The heart of identifying the surrounding context is observing how your section relates to what comes before it and what comes after it. Let’s try to identify the surrounding context of Philemon 4–7.
   
   Our section (vv. 4–7) is sandwiched between the opening of the letter (vv. 1–3) and the body of the letter (vv. 8–22). Almost everything that Paul says in the thanksgiving and prayer passage prepares the reader for what he is about to say in the body of the letter. **Paul attributes a number of qualities to Philemon in verses 4–7, the very qualities that will enable Philemon to respond positively to Paul’s upcoming request.** Thus, the thanksgiving and prayer section (vv. 4–7) prepares the way for the body of the letter. **Philemon’s good qualities that are highlighted in verses 4–7 provide the character anchor that will motivate him to do what Paul is about to request in the rest of the letter. When we study Philemon 4–7 with its surrounding context in view, we can truly grasp the meaning of the passage.**

## Conclusion

We study literary context because the interpretation that best fits the context is the most valid interpretation. **When we disregard literary context, we run the risk of forcing the Bible to say what we want it to say.** This may appear to satisfy people’s immediate needs, but ultimately, this approach hurts people by robbing them of God’s liberating truth. People are seeking time-tested answers to problems that are staring them in the face, answers that contemporary culture simply cannot supply. When we take the literary context seriously, we are saying, “We want to hear what God is trying to say to us.”

In this chapter **we have learned that literary context consists of both literary genre and the context surrounding your passage.** Literary genre functions like a covenant of communication between the author and the reader. As readers it is our job to be faithful to this covenant by playing by the game rules established by the author. The surrounding context shows us that every passage lives in a world surrounded by other passages. We ourselves communicate by connecting our words, sentences, and paragraphs into a coherent message, and the Bible does the same. **We reviewed two of the most common dangers associated with disregarding literary context and underscored the importance of knowing the immediate context of a passage.** We concluded the chapter by suggesting three steps to identifying surrounding context, using Philemon as our example. As you honor the literary context of a passage of Scripture, you will be saying through your actions that above all, you want to hear what God has to say to you through his Word.
