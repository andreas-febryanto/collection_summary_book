# The Literary Context

Have you ever tried to put together one of those thousand-piece puzzles? The box cover features a majestic mountain scene or a picture of three cute kittens in a basket. Then you dump out all one thousand pieces and start to recreate the picture. Again and again you pick up a puzzle piece, look at its shape and its colors, and try to fit it into the larger scheme of things. Every piece contributes something to the picture even as the larger picture gives definition to each individual piece.

Words are like pieces of a puzzle. **They fit together to form a story or a paragraph in a letter (i.e., the big picture).** Until you know the meaning of certain words, you will not be able to grasp the meaning of the whole passage. Not knowing the meaning of certain words in a passage of Scripture can be compared to the frustrating discovery that you don’t have all the pieces to your puzzle. **Like individual pieces of a puzzle, words bring the larger picture to life.**

New Testament scholar Gordon Fee says that the aim of word study **is to try to understand as precisely as possible what the author was trying to convey by his use of this word in this context.** As readers *we do not determine the meaning of biblical words*; rather, *we try to discover what the biblical writer meant when he used a particular word*. We should always keep in mind this distinction between determining meaning and discovering meaning.

**Even if you don’t know the original biblical languages, Hebrew and Greek, you can still learn to use interpretive tools to do a word study properly**, and we will show you how. We start the chapter by alerting you to common mistakes people make when studying words. Then we go on to explain how to identify words in a passage that need further study, how to determine what a word could mean, and finally how to decide what a word does mean in context. Your reward for studying words carefully will often be a breathtaking view of a majestic biblical scene.

## Common Word-Study Fallacies<sup>2</sup>

The list could be much longer, but this should give you some idea of what to avoid when studying words.

#### English-Only Fallacy

Because the Bible was not originally written in English, it must be translated into English from the original biblical languages, Hebrew and Greek. This fact can complicate word studies for students who do not know the original languages. example:

1. You may not realize that a word in Hebrew or Greek is often translated into English by a number of different English words. For example, the Greek word paraklēsis is translated in the NIV with the following English words: “comfort, encouragement, appeal, be encouraged, consolation, encourage, encouraged, encouraging message, exhortation, greatly encouraged, preaching, urgently.” **You will immediately notice that English words like “comfort” and “exhortation” can mean different things depending on the context.**

2. English-language students may not be aware that **different words in Hebrew or Greek can be translated into English using the same English word.** For instance, the NIV uses the word “comfort” to translate these different Greek words: parakaleō, paraklēsis, paramytheomai, paramythia, paramythion, parēgoria.

The English-only fallacy occurs when you base your word study on the English word rather than the underlying Greek or Hebrew word and, as a result, draw unreliable or misleading conclusions.

#### Root Fallacy

The notion that the real meaning of a word is found in its original root (i.e., in the etymology of the word). Think about how silly this can be even in English. Is a butterfly actually a fly that has lost control and crash-landed into a tub of butter? Is a pineapple a certain kind of apple that grows only on pine trees? What in the world is a sawhorse?

Switching from English to a biblical language doesn’t automatically change things. Just because someone can spout off the component parts of a Greek word doesn’t mean that he or she has discovered the “real meaning” of the word. *It is true that a word’s individual parts may accurately portray its meaning, but only if the context supports such a meaning*. **Give context priority over etymology, and you will be on solid ground.**

#### Time-Frame Fallacy

The time-frame fallacy occurs when we latch onto a late word meaning (usually a meaning popular in our own time) and read it back into the Bible, or when we insist that an early word meaning still holds when in fact it has since become obsolete. D. A. Carson uses the English word dynamite and the Greek word dynamis (sometimes translated “power”) to illustrate a particular form of the time-frame fallacy:

Romans 1: 16

Most certainly Paul was not thinking of the English word dynamite when he wrote the Greek word dynamis since the English word originated centuries later.

**Confusing the two word meanings is misleading and dangerous**. Do we really want to read this late word meaning back into the New Testament and conclude that God’s power destroys like a terrorist bomb when Paul himself says in this verse that God’s power leads to salvation for everyone who believes? Carson concludes: “Of course, *what preachers are trying to do when they talk about dynamite is give some indication of the greatness of the power involved*. Even so, Paul’s measure is not dynamite, but the empty tomb.”

#### Overload Fallacy

**Most words can mean several different things**. **The overload fallacy is the idea that a word will include all of those senses every time it is used**. For example, the English word spring can refer to a season, a metal coil, an act of jumping, or a source of water. You would be overloading spring (pun intended... perhaps) to assume that in every passage in which it occurs, the word carries not just one, but all, of those senses. Which meaning for spring does the context demand in the sentence, “Spring is my favorite season of the year”? If you said “all of the above” or even if you chose any meaning except a season of the year, you would be guilty of the overload fallacy.

#### Word-Count Fallacy

The word-count fallacy is a mistake we make **when we insist that a word must have the same meaning every time it occurs**. For example, if we are confident that a word carries a certain meaning in seven of its eight occurrences in Scripture, we might be tempted to conclude that it must have that same meaning in its eighth occurrence. Yet, as Darrell Bock maintains, **“word meanings are determined by context, not word counts.”**

#### Word-Concept Fallacy

We fall prey to the word-concept fallacy **when we assume that once we have studied one word, we have studied an entire concept**. If, for example, you want to discover what the New Testament says about the church, you should certainly study the word translated “church” (ekklēsia). Yet it would be a mistake to conclude that once you have studied ekklēsia, you will know all that the New Testament teaches about church. *A concept is bigger than any one word*. **To see what the New Testament says about the church, you need to broaden your study to include ideas like “body of Christ,” “temple of the Holy Spirit,” and “household of faith.” The concept of church is much broader than the one word ekklēsia.**

#### Selective-Evidence Fallacy

**When we cite just the evidence that supports our favored interpretation or when we dismiss evidence that seems to argue against our view**, we commit the selective-evidence fallacy. **This error is particularly dangerous because here we are intentionally tampering with the biblical evidence whereas in other fallacies the mistakes may be unintentional**. Although we want the Bible to support our convictions in every case, there will be times when its message confronts us for our own good. When that happens, **we should change our view rather than twist Scripture to advance our own agenda**. Before you begin studying a word in the Bible, **make up your mind to accept all the evidence**.

Now it is time to learn how to do a word study. The process consists of three steps: 

1. Choosing your words

2. Determining what the word could mean

3. Determining what the word does mean in context.

## Choose Your Words Carefully

Doing a word study properly takes time. Be realistic and admit that you cannot possibly study every word in your passage and still have any time for your friends. In fact, you don’t need to study every word. Most biblical passages are filled with words whose meanings are clear and plain to the average reader. **But some words do demand more in-depth study**. Guidelines to help you choose the words you need to study:

1. **Look for words that are crucial to the passage**. Everything in the passage depends on the meaning of these words. They are loaded with historical or theological significance. They bear the weight of the passage. Often the crucial words in a passage will be the key nouns and/or verbs.

2. **Look for repeated words**. Usually the author will signal theme words by repeating them, so pay close attention to words that are repeated (e.g., “comfort” in 2 Cor. 1:3–7, “blessed” in Matt. 5:1–12, or “remain” in John 15:1–11). Study these words for sure.

3. **Look for figures of speech**. Here words are used not in a literal sense but as word pictures or images. When you read Jesus’ statement “I am the gate” (John 10:9) or read about trees “clapping their hands” (Isa. 55:12), you are looking at figures. Since the meaning of many figures or images is not automatically obvious, you may need to study them further. For example, the image of a lion refers to Jesus Christ in Revelation 5:5 and to Satan in 1 Peter 5:8.

4. **Look for words that are unclear, puzzling, or difficult**. Perhaps you don’t understand the English definition of a word. Or you may find that English translations differ widely when it comes to this particular word. Or a writer may be using a word in a technical or specialized sense. A good rule of thumb here is that “the most important words are those that give you trouble,” and if a word gives you trouble, study it some more.

Example: Romans 12:1–2 and Matthew 28:19–20. Remember, look for crucial words, repeated words, images, and difficult words.

![9.2.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/9.2.png)

Don’t be surprised if you didn’t pick the same words we picked and don’t be alarmed if you picked fewer. What’s most important is that you think through why you would want to study certain words.

## Determine What the Word Could Mean

Why do we need to determine what the word could mean before we decide what it does mean? **Because most words can mean several different things** (e.g., spring), **but will usually carry only one of those meanings in a particular context.** By clarifying what a word could mean, we will not confuse the various meanings of a word when interpreting a particular passage of Scripture.

Consider this scenario. If, in the dead of winter, your friend says, “It’s so cold, I can’t wait until spring gets here,” **he would be referring to the arrival of the much warmer season that immediately follows winter**, not **the arrival of a metal coil or an improved jumping ability**. Imagine the absurdity of the statement, “It’s so cold, I can’t wait until my jumping ability improves.” You might begin to wonder if the cold had dulled your friend’s mental capacity.

#### Semantic Range

Once we see all the possible meanings of a word — what we refer to as a word’s range of meaning or semantic range — we will be in a better position to decide what the word actually does mean in a specific context. For example, let’s look at the semantic range of the English word hand. To find the range of meaning for an English word, just look it up in a standard English dictionary (also called a lexicon). A glance at the dictionary entry for hand reveals a range of meaning that looks something like this:

- the terminal part of a vertebrate forelimb (my right hand)

- a personal possession (it fell into the hands of the enemy)

- a side (on the one hand... on the other hand)

- a pledge (I give you my hand in marriage)

- a style of penmanship (this letter was written in my own hand)

- a skill or ability (she tried her hand at sailing)

- a unit of measure (the horse is fifteen hands high)

- aid or assistance (please lend me a hand)

- cards in a card game (I was dealt a bad hand)

- one who performs a particular work (they employ over fifty
  hands)

- workmanship or handiwork (the work of the master’s hand)

> A word’s range of meaning (or semantic range) is a list of all the possible meanings of a word — that is, a list of what the word could mean.

Since the Bible was not originally written in English, you are really trying to find the range of meaning for a Greek or Hebrew word, not the English word used in translation.

Both the original-language word (Hebrew or Greek) and the English word used to translate it will have a semantic range. There will be some overlap between the semantic ranges of the two words; that’s what makes translation possible. But the ranges will not be identical. We must remember that they are different words and will almost always have different (but overlapping) ranges of meaning.

ex: Matt. 25:14; cf. also 25:20, 22.

"entrust" narrow range of meaning:

1. to confer a trust on; to deliver something in trust to

2. to commit to another with confidence

The Greek word `paradidōmi`, the word the NIV translates “entrust,” has a much broader range of meaning:

1. to hand over something to someone

2. to deliver someone into the control of someone else; to betray

3. to commend or commit

4. to pass on traditional instruction

5. to grant someone the opportunity to do something; to allow or
   permit

The NIV can use the word “entrust” to translate the Greek word paradidōmi because the semantic ranges of the two words overlap. In Jesus’ parable the master is “entrusting” in the sense of (a) in both lists above; that is, he is handing over (or entrusting) his property to the servants while he is away on a journey.

Here things get tricky. We could get into interpretive trouble if we were to say, for example, that the English word “entrust” could mean “betray” (which it cannot) or that the Greek word paradidōmi could never mean “betray” (which it can). We don’t want you to misinterpret by confusing the semantic ranges for different words. **Avoid the temptation to pick just any meaning from a list of possible meanings and read that meaning back into the passage**. Always keep in mind as well that the original-language word and the translation word are different words with different ranges of meaning that overlap to some degree. The overlap is what makes translation possible. **Your task is to locate the point of overlap**.

Now back to our main task: **determining what the word — the Greek or Hebrew word, not the English word** — could mean. How do we find the range of meaning for the original-language word that underlies our English translation? We suggest you do `two things`.

#### Concordance Work

The first step is to use an exhaustive concordance to locate the original Hebrew or Greek word.

ex: Phillippians 3: 12

First, look up the word “press” in the concordance and then scroll down to Philippians 3:12 to get the assigned number you will need to find the original Greek word In this case the word “press” has the number 1503 (see below).

Now turn to the “Greek to English Dictionary and Index” in the back of the same concordance and find the number 1503. Here you can see the original Greek word that is translated “press on” in Philippians 3:12 (transliterated diōkō). You also learn how many times this particular word is used in the New Testament, a list of related words (1501, 1502, 1691, 2870), a list of word definitions, and a list of the different ways the NIV translates the word (see below). From the list of word definitions and the ways the NIV translates the Greek word diōkō, you can begin to see a semantic range coming into view.

These word definitions provided in the concordance are merely ways in which the NIV has translated the Greek or Hebrew word. **These definitions provide a starting point for finding the word’s semantic range**. As you do your own study of the original word, however, **you may find yourself arriving at different conclusions from the NIV translators**. Don’t feel bound by the ways the NIV has translated the Greek or Hebrew word, but **these definitions do offer a place to begin your own study**.

![9.4.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/9.4.png)

#### Context Studies

But we need to take the process one step further. What if you are studying the word “door” in the context of 2 Corinthians 2:12

In the NIV the word “door” (G/K 2598 — thyra) is translated “door,” “doors,” “gate,” “entrance,” “doorway,” “gates,” and “outer entrance.” But in 2 Corinthians 2:12 **it is obvious that when Paul uses this word here, he is talking about an opportunity for ministry, not a physical door**. In this case, even though the concordance tells you the word is translated “door” in 2 Corinthians 2:12, the meaning is not what it appears. **The only way to determine what Paul means by “door” here is to look more carefully at the specific context**.

That brings us to the second thing you can do to discover a word’s range of meaning. You must examine the context to see how your word is used. The one rule in doing word studies that overrules all other rules is this: `Context determines word meaning`. **If you take any word out of its context, you cannot really tell what it means**.

Consequently, to be confident about knowing a word’s range of meaning, you must see how it is used in context and not just how it has been translated into English.

To check the context you need to know where the Greek or Hebrew word actually occurs in Scripture, and then you need to look up each occurrence. **Checking the context is a crucial step in determining what the word could mean**.

> In summary, before you decide what your word does mean, you need to determine what it could mean. You must use an exhaustive concordance to find the original Hebrew or Greek word and see its definitions and its translations into English. Then you must use the concordance again to check the context surrounding your word. Now for the final step — it’s time to decide what your word actually does mean in the context of the passage.

---

## Decide What the Word Does Mean in Context

In light of the context, the first thing you must do is to select from the possible meanings the one meaning that best fits your word. What we said earlier about the importance of context bears repeating: Context determines word meaning! Context includes everything that surrounds your word, such as the paragraph containing the word, the subject matter, the author’s argument or flow of thought, as well as external factors such as the historical situation of the author and the original audience.

One of the most reliable ways to let the context guide your decision is through a concept known as `circles of context` (the diagram below illustrates the circles of context for a New Testament word; the same principle would also apply to the study of Old Testament words).

![9.8.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/9.8.png)

Generally speaking, **the closer the circle is to the center, the greater influence it should normally have on your decision about the word’s meaning**. When trying to decide the meaning of a New Testament word, for example, **you would usually give more weight to writings by the same author** (and especially to the word’s immediate context) than to other parts of the New Testament. All of this is based on the notion that we should **look first and foremost to the original author to discover the meaning of the word**.

> Your goal when using the circles of context is to start with the immediate context and work your way out until you find your answer. Rarely will you have to move beyond the “same author” circle to answer the question about the meaning of the word. (The double lines in the diagram signal the priority you should give to everything written by the same author.)

**You should expect to spend most of your time working in the smaller circles of context**. Remember that our purpose in doing word studies is to try to understand as precisely as possible what the author meant when he used a certain word in a specific context. We cannot stop our analysis when we know the possible meanings of the word. We must go on to choose the meaning that is most likely. As you struggle to decide the most likely meaning of the word in its context, you may find the following questions helpful.

- **Is there a contrast or a comparison that seems to define the word?** For example, Ephesians 4:29 reads: “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.” The contrast in the immediate context between “unwholesome” talk and words that build up and benefit people helps us understand **`unwholesome` talk as any kind of speech (not just profanity) that damages relationships**.

- **Does the subject matter or topic of the passage dictate a word meaning?** Back to our Genesis 39 example (NIV: “make sport of”). Which category did you choose of the various possibilities? **Although “make sport of” sounds very much like sense (d) (“to ridicule or mock”), the subject matter in the immediate context is clearly sexual in nature. Could it be that sense (c) (“to caress physically”) is the more likely choice?** Read 39:14–15 again in light of the topic of the passage and see what you think.

- **Does the author’s usage of the same word elsewhere in a similar context help you decide which meaning best fits the word?** If you are studying the word “world” in the all-time favorite verse John 3:16 (“For God so loved the world...”), for instance, you would be interested to know how John uses this word elsewhere in his writings. **To save you time we can tell you that John uses the term “world” in a variety of ways, but he often uses the word in the sense of human beings in rebellion against God, of people opposed to God and his purposes.** John probably uses “world” in this sense in John 3:16 also. When we read that God so loved the “world,” we are not to think merely of God’s affection for his physical creation, but of God’s willingness to send his Son to die for those who despise him. Knowing John’s use of “world” gives you a glimpse into the self-giving heart of God.

- Does the author’s argument in the book suggest a meaning? At times the author’s argument (or train of thought) will affect your decision about what the word means. In Galatians 3:4 Paul asks the Galatians a pointed question: “Have you suffered so much for nothing...?” (NIV 1984). **The Greek word translated “suffered” (paschō) can mean (a) negative experiences (i.e., suffering) or (b) positive experiences**. Most of the time in the New Testament the word carries this negative sense of suffering, as it does the other six times Paul uses the word (1 Cor. 12:26; 2 Cor. 1:6; Phil. 1:29; 1 Thess. 2:14; 2 Thess. 1:5; 2 Tim. 1:12). But his argument in Galatians seems to call for meaning (b). **If you were to study Galatians thoroughly, you would see that in this section Paul recalls the Galatians’ positive experience of the Spirit, speaking in the surrounding verses of God’s gift of his Spirit and miracles**. Paul then asks them if they are giving up all their great spiritual experiences for nothing. Because of the author’s argument in the immediate context, the NIV 2011 translation of paschō as “experience” seems preferable: “Have you experienced so much in vain...?”

- **Does the historical situation tilt the evidence in a certain direction?** Occasionally the historical context will strongly favor a particular option. To the Philippian Christians Paul writes, “Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ” (1:27). The key verb translated “conduct yourselves” (politeuomai) probably carries political overtones that Paul makes use of to connect with the Philippians. **The citizens of Philippi took great pride in their status as citizens of a Roman colony**. The Christians in Philippi would likely have shared in this civic pride. **Paul seems to be telling the believers there to make sure they live like citizens of heaven in Philippi and not merely like citizens of a Roman colony**. After all, the real Lord is not Caesar but Jesus! Knowing the historical background can often help you discern a word’s meaning.

> Now, using these questions and others like them, select the meaning that best fits. **Sometimes you will discover that more than one sense is possible, maybe even several are possible. But you need to decide which one best fits the context. Resist the temptation to select a word meaning only because it is more exciting than the other options or because it will “preach” better than the rest.** What good is a captivating word meaning if it is not true to the text of Scripture? As you make your decision, remember that interpretation always involves an element of subjectivity. Therefore, we need to make our interpretive choices and hold our interpretive convictions with humility. We could be wrong. It has happened before.

## A Word Study: "Offer" in Romans 12:1

1. **Choose your words carefully**
   
   In view of God’s mercy, what are we supposed to do? We are to “offer” our bodies to God. Knowing more about the meaning of this key verb will help us see how we are to respond to God in light of all he has done for us.

2. **Determine what the word could mean**
   
   Let’s use our concordance to find the range of meaning for the word.
   
   Since the English word offer is a translation of a Greek word, find the number 4225 in the “Greek to English Dictionary and Index” in the back of the concordance.
   
   ![9.9.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/9.9.png)
   
   ![9.10.png](/home/andreas/Documents/playground/collection_summary_book/religious/grasping_gods_word/Part_2/image/9.10.png)
   
   A list of word definitions and the different ways in which the NIV translates the Greek word paristēmi (G/K 4225)
   
   By looking at the context of each occurrence of paristēmi, we can put together the word’s range of meaning:
   
   - to make available, to put at someone’s disposal, to provide (e.g., Matt. 26:53: “Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?”)
   
   - to arrive, to come (e.g., Mark 4:29: “As soon as the grain is
     ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.”)
   
   - to stand by, to be present (e.g., Mark 14:47: “Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.”)
   
   - to present someone to someone (e.g., Luke 2:22: “When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.”); note too that occasionally the someone is presented as something (e.g., Col. 1:22: “But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation.”)
   
   - to stand against, to appear as an enemy (e.g., Acts 4:26: “The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one.”)
   
   - to prove or demonstrate (e.g., Acts 24:13: “And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.”)
   
   - to appear before a judge (e.g., Acts 27:24: “[He] said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar.’ ”)
   
   - to help (e.g., Rom. 16:2: “I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people, including me.”)
   
   - to bring close or near (e.g., 1 Cor. 8:8: “But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.”)

3. **Decide the most likely meaning of the word in context**
   
   We must look carefully at the use of paristēmi in Romans 12:1. Beginning in 12:1 Paul shifts his focus to how Christians should respond to their experience of God’s mercy in Christ (detailed in chs. 1–11). The word “therefore” signals this transition from the theological foundation in Chapters 1–11 to the exhortation in Chapters 12–15. We are urged to respond to God by presenting or offering our bodies as a sacrifice.
   
   Of the possible meanings for paristēmi listed above, the context suggests either sense (a) “to make available, to put at someone’s disposal, to provide” or sense (d) “to present someone to someone” as the best options. **These are closely related meanings, and it is difficult to determine which one is best. We turn again to the context.**
   
   This word is used elsewhere in Romans in 6:13, 16, 19; 14:10; and 16:2. The parallels between the use of the word in Chapter 12 and the uses in Chapter 6 are strong. In both cases people are giving their bodies in service to some power. **Since “body” probably refers here to the whole person and not just to the physical body, sense (d) seems preferable: We are giving ourselves to God.**
   
   We should also pay particular attention to the imagery of sacrifice in chapter 12, imagery not present in chapter 6. In 12:1 we are exhorted to offer our bodies as a sacrifice. Since Christ has fulfilled the Old Testament sacrificial system, Christians no longer offer literal sacrifices as part of our worship. Instead, we offer ourselves totally and continuously to God as a sacrifice — a living, holy, and pleasing sacrifice.
   
   God gave himself to us through the once-for-all sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. We worship God by giving all of ourselves (bodies included) to him. Two kinds of sacrifice are involved: he died for us, and we are to live for him!

## Conclusion

Words are the building blocks of language, connecting like small pieces of a puzzle to bring the larger picture to life. As we grasp the meaning of individual words, we are able to comprehend the meaning of an entire passage. Yet, as we have seen in this chapter, the meaning of a word is determined by the context surrounding that word. Context determines word meaning just as word meaning helps form the context. 



Next, you learned how to locate words that need further study and how to study the underlying Hebrew or Greek word using a concordance.

1. Choose your words carefully

2. Determine what the word could mean

3. Decide the most likely meaning of the word in context.

Finally, we encouraged you to check your work by consulting the experts.
