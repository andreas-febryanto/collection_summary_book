# Verbal Judo as an Automatic Response

#### The Principles of Impartiality

1. Always maintain your professional face; never strive to save your personal face. Your personal face is ego on your sleeve, your expression of irritation, anger, and bias. I would have paid somebody to teach me that principle when I was twenty-one.

2. Always treat the other person as you would want to be treated under identical circumstances. The next time your children misbehave, treat them as you wish you had been treated when you were that age. Too often people grow up and become just like the parents they resented.

#### More On My List

3. Be careful to distinguish between reasonable and severe resistance. Reasonable resistance is any kind of verbal resistance you encounter that does not interfere with your ability to complete your job. When you think about it, it is fairly common. Let it go. Ignore it. Don’t let it annoy or distract you. It ties in with my reminder to let a person say what he wants as long as he does what you say.

4. Every verbal encounter is unique. In the workplace, remember that your customers don’t realize they are asking you the same question you have been asked a dozen times already. To each the question is important. The forty-first person who calls does not want to be treated as if he had called forty times earlier.
   
   **Make that forty-first caller feel as if he were your first or only call of the day. Empathize!**

5. As a contact professional, you alone have the responsibility to create and maintain continuous rapport with people. Don’t expect others to become pleasant, malleable, or compliant.

6. **Always check your own assumptions**. Your assumptions may be wrong. Be aware of your influence. For example, I answered a call about a loud party once, took a lot of verbal abuse, and had to be forthright to get them to turn down the volume. Forty minutes later I was called back again, this time naturally assuming that I would be treated the same way. I approached the scene with more vigor and negativity, only to be surprised that they were much more compliant this time, and we were able to settle the matter for good. I was fortunate I didn’t make the situation worse by allowing my logical, but false, assumption to make me act inappropriately.

7. Control encounters; don’t become a victim of them.
   If you can’t control yourself, you can’t control the situation. It starts with you. You have to be in control to create control.

8. Use adrenaline; never be ruled by it. As people hassle you and put pressure on you, take pride in your role and think like Michael Jordan: The more others pour it on, the better you should play.

9. Respond to people; never react.
   When you are responding, you are in control. You are reanswering, responding to the event with power. When, on the other hand, you react, the event is controlling you.

10. Flexibility equals strength; rigidity equals weakness. Take pride in your ability to bend and flex, looking for voluntary compliance, working toward better communication.

11. Avoid the depersonalization of abstraction. Keep your language specific. Abstraction has a killing quality.
    
    Abstract depersonalization is destroying our society. Don’t let your children label a person racially, instead of as an individual, or they will never be able to skillfully or successfully interact with those different from themselves. Teach them the power and dignity of specificity and personalization.

12. Use positive feedback when you least feel like it. There’s real skill in being positive when what you feel is negative.
    
    Try that with the people in your orbit. Do the unexpected. If they expect you to be negative, be positive.

13. Use self-talk to maintain control when under assault. PAVPO: Perspective, Audience, Voice, Purpose, Organization—the overview of rhetorical perspective.
    PACE: Problem, Audience, Constraints, Ethical presence—the way to read a scene.
    LEAPS: Listen, Empathize, Ask, Paraphrase, Summarize—the five great tools of communication.

14. Never violate the equity principle. Treat people equally, regardless of their age, race, appearance, or apparent value to you.

15. Cultivate your constituency; don’t try to run people’s lives. If a customer or an employee is difficult, for example, try going the extra mile for him. He’s not expecting that, and he will never forget it.

#### For The Toughest Cases

16. It’s not enough to be good; you’ve got to look good and sound good or it’s no good. “Not enough to be good; got to look good or no good.”

17. Say what you want as long as you do what I say. I teach that they should allow a citizen to say what he wants as long as he cooperates. Who cares what he says? He’s usually just trying to save face.

18. You can have the last word, because I have the last act is a principle associated with the previous one. Obviously it is a police principle and does not apply when you’re simply trying to negotiate with a service person or an equal.
    
    Your employee can cuss you out and flip over you desk, and if it fits your purpose you can sit there smiling benignly. He knows as well as you do that the final verdict -- likely his dismissal -- lies with you.

19. Never use those words that rise most readily to your lips, for the moment you do you will give the greatest speech you’ll ever live to regret.
    
    The words that rise most readily to your lips are always reactive rather than responsive. You must choose your words with an eye on the goal: What is the one thing I want to accomplish?

20. If it doesn’t work with Mama, don’t use it on the street. This is merely a simple way to remember that you have to treat everyone as you treat your family.

21.  If it makes you feel good, no good. Sadly, it makes you feel good to stroke your own ego, to put somebody down, to tear into someone. 

22. Never step on someone’s personal face. 

23. The less ego you show; the more power you have over others. 

24. Men are like steel; when they lose their temper, they are useless. Fine-tempered steel has strength. Steel that lacks temper breaks under stress.

25. When your mouth opens, your ears slam shut. When you’re talking, you cannot listen. Listening is a highly active, artificial skill.

26. Common sense is most uncommon under pressure. Keep your cool and you’ll maintain your common sense.
