# You Can Punish Without Drawing Blood

Never mix emotion and punishment.

#### Keep In Mind

If you’re so angry at someone that you simply must express it, do so. **But be careful not to effect punishment at the same time.**

If you have to chew out an employee, do it. But don’t, in the excitement of the moment, say, “You’re finished in this company. I’d fire you if I could. You’re on probation for six months. No raise for you, etc., etc., etc.”

The moment you use words that indicate you have lost respect for someone or don’t like him, he shuts down and quits listening. Your personal self has intruded and spoiled your professionalism.

#### The Goal

So, if you want to be an effective punisher, you must learn to use language disinterestedly, unemotionally, and without bias. **The goal of punishment should be positive. It is not to inflict pain or exact revenge. Rather it is to reconstruct, to make better, to educate.**

Train yourself to do the opposite of what you feel. If you feel like shouting, whisper. If you feel like striking, caress. If you feel like storming from the room, stay put. Take control. Feel the power it gives you. Above all, separate emotion from punishment.
