# Five Truths

What is true of all cultures? I came up with these truths:

1. All cultures want to be respected and treated with dignity, regardless of the situation. When treated with disrespect, all people want to fight and get revenge.

2. All people would rather be asked than told what to do. To ask is a sign of respect; to tell is often a sign of disrespect.

3. All people want to know why they are being asked or told to do something. Telling people why is another sign of respect and based on my own research on the streets of America, I’ve found that it calms about 70 percent of Difficult People. Not telling people why is a sign of disrespect and lowers morale in all organizations, including one’s own family.

4. All people would rather have options than threats. Again, offering people a choice of action shows respect and allows people to save personal face. Threats are not only disrespectful, they force people, if they have any backbone, to resist and fight.

5. Finally, all people want a second chance to make matters right. People are human; we err and act in ways we wish we hadn’t. Whenever appropriate, people value being given a second chance to get it right.

These five truths are indeed universal, regardless of culture, color, race, gender, or sexual preference.
