# Verbal Judo Versus Verbal Karate

Judo, as I’ve pointed out, was developed as a sport of self-defense without the use of weapons. Karate is defined as a self-defense system characterized by sharp, quick blows delivered with the hands and feet.

Verbal Karate is the lashing out, as if with the side of a calloused hand, when you snap at your spouse, your children, your employer, your employees, anyone. Whenever you use in a harmful, destructive way those words that rise readily to your lips, you have employed the easiest use of language: Verbal Karate.

In fact, Verbal Karate burned more bridges, alienated more people, and lost more opportunities for me than anything else I can think of. Oh, it often made me feel good about myself temporarily.

#### The Bad News

People never forget verbal abuse. It sinks deeper and festers longer than any other kind of abuse. I’d rather be cut with a sword than with an insult from someone I care about.

#### The Gentle Way

Physical judo was invented by a Dr. Kano in 1882. It was a derivative of jujitsu, which means “pain.” Means the gentle way, rather than the painful way. People are thrown or foot-swept to the mat. The gentleness lies in the technique. You are not counteracting their approach and hammering back at them. Rather, you are moving with them, using their momentum to pull them off-balance and then propelling them to the ground. The way you throw someone allows him to break the fall and roll out of it. Verbal Judo, then, should be nonhurtful. It should be redirective rather than confrontational.

#### Mastery Through Adapting

Verbal Judo was the martial arts of the mind and the mouth, the ability to keep calm inside, to read the audience and find the right words for the right person at the right time.

Aristotle said that audiences are made, not found. You can trip over people who are angry and hostile, but if you’re skillful, you can calm and redirect their behavior in two minutes.

#### Force Options

The goal of persuasion is to generate voluntary compliance. You can’t expect it just because you play a certain authority role. You must make it happen. The great communicators have that art. They somehow get people to do what they want them to do by getting them to want to do it.

The first, surprisingly enough, is your mere presence: the way you show up, the way you approach, carry yourself, stand around, even the way you project your feelings onto your face. I teach police officers and corporate people the importance of professional presence, how they look as they enter a scene.

Consider, for example, a typical mistake: using the wrong facial expression—often with the wrong words. Many think they are going to cool people down and take charge of a situation by showing an angry, eyes-squinted-up, snarling face. That calms nobody down. If you want to calm somebody, don’t you think it would be more helpful to affect a calm, pleasant, interested look?

#### How Many Faces?

We all wear dozens of faces everyday. Which you use when will determine how successful you are in generating voluntary compliance.

Learn the skill of the chameleon. The chameleon is a good representation of an effective communicator because of its ability to adapt to its environment. Just as the chameleon changes colors to blend in, you must wear faces appropriate to changing situations. The chameleon survives because it adapts. No matter how you feel inside, you must develop the ability to look good on the outside—to reinforce what you’re saying with a face and a demeanor that fits the situation.

Force option number two is verbalization: the right words for the right person at the right time. As Napoleon said, “More powerful than a standing army is the well-wrought word.” Most of us do not communicate skillfully under pressure. hy not use a phrase like “It’s gonna be all right. I’m working on it.”

#### Four More Force Options

laying hands on a person and using techniques from the martial arts called the come-along holds. Obviously, these are limited to law enforcement personnel, and they help generate voluntary compliance at the lowest level of pain possible.

Option number four is the use of artificial incapacitators—chemical mace, stun guns, the kind of force that temporarily immobilizes so the police officer can generate voluntary compliance.

The fifth option, using impact tools like the nightstick or the baton, is not designed to permanently injure or brutalize people.

Option number six is deadly force, and, of course, that has nothing to do with generating voluntary compliance. Deadly force is used for enforced compliance, and there are strict rules—such as imminent jeopardy and preclusion (meaning no other force options are available)—that tell us when such extreme measures are allowed.

#### Your Options

One of the secrets of being a good communicator is knowing the system. Be sure you are well versed in policy. Too many people use threats they don’t have the power to carry out.

Know what you can enforce and at what level you can enforce it. That gives you confidence and credibility. Credibility, which is rooted in the Latin word credo, meaning “I believe,” begins and ends with your use of words.

The birth of my ability to communicate came in my acceptance of the fact that I was the problem. If you can accept that the problem with your spouse, your children, or at your workplace may be in your mirror, you can make dramatic changes in your ability to be skillful under pressure. Focus on technique, focus on the goal.
