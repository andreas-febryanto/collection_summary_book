# Part 2: How to Know What to Say After You Say "Hi"

Just as the first glimpse should please their eyes, your first words should delight their ears. Your tongue is a welcome mat embossed with either “Welcome” or “Go Away!” To make your conversation partner feel welcome, you must master small talk.

## How to start great small talk

We want the first words falling from our lips to be sparkling, witty, and insightful. We want our listeners to immediately recognize how riveting we are. I was once at a gathering where everybody was sparkling, witty, insightful, and riveting.

You see, small talk is not about facts or words. It’s about music, about melody. Small talk is about putting people at ease. It’s about making comforting noises together like cats purring, children humming, or groups chanting. You must first match your listener’s mood.

The first step in starting a conversation without strangling it is to match your listener’s mood, if only for a sentence or two. When it comes to small talk, think music, not words. Is your listener adagio or allegro Match that pace. I call it “Make a Mood Match.”

#### Matching Their Mood Can Make or Break the Sale

Every mother knows this instinctively. To quiet a whimpering infant, Mama doesn’t just shake her finger and shout, “Quiet down.” No, Mama picks baby up. Mama cries, “Ooh, ooh, oh,” sympathetically matching baby’s misery for a few moments. Mama then gradually transitions the two of them into hush-hush happy sounds. Your listeners are all big babies! Match their mood if you want them to stop crying, start buying, or otherwise come ’round to your way of thinking.

> Technique 10.**Make a Mood Match** 
> 
> 
> 
> Before opening your mouth, take a “voice sample” of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a “psychic photograph” of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.

## How to sound like you've got a super personality (no matter what you're saying!)

I went over to hearken to this fascinating speaker. I joined his throng of admirers and eavesdropped for a minute or two. Suddenly, it dawned on me: the fellow was saying the most banal things! His script was dull, dull, dull. Ah, but he was delivering his prosaic observations with such passion, and therefore, he held the group spellbound. It convinced me that it’s not all what you say, it’s how you say it.

#### "What's a Good Opening Line When I Meet People"

Frustrating though it may be, my answer to the opening-line question is “Anything!” because almost anything you say really is OK—as long as it puts people at ease and sounds passionate.

How do you put people at ease? By convincing them they are OK and that the two of you are similar. When you do that, you break down walls of fear, suspicion, and mistrust.

#### Ascent from Banality

It is not necessary, of course, to stay with mundane remarks. If you find your company displays cleverness or wit, you match that. The conversation then escalates naturally, compatibly. Don’t rush it or, like the Mensans, you seem like you’re showing off. The bottom line on your first words is to have the courage of your own triteness. Because, remember, people tune in to your tone more than your text.

> Technique 11.**Prosaic with Passion**
> 
> 
> Worried about your first words? Fear not, because 80 percent of your listener’s impression has nothing to do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting.

#### "Anything Except Liverwurst!"

Here’s my “anything, except liverwurst” on small talk. Anything you say is fine as long as it is not complaining, rude, or unpleasant. If the first words out of your mouth are a complaint—BLAM—people label you a complainer. Why? Because that complaint is your new acquaintance’s 100 percent sampling of you so far. You could be the happiest Pollyanna ever, but how will they know? If your first comment is a complaint, you’re a griper. If your first words are rude, you’re a creep. If your first words are unpleasant, you’re a stinker. Open and shut.

Ask them where they’re from, how they know the host of the party, where they bought the lovely suit they’re wearing—or hundreds of etceteras. The trick is to ask your prosaic question with passion to get the other person talking.

## How to make people want to start a conversation with you

What’s a Whatzit? A Whatzit is anything you wear or carry that is unusual—a unique pin, an interesting purse, a strange tie, or an amusing hat. A Whatzit is any object that draws people’s attention and inspires them to approach you and ask, “Uh, what’s that?” Your Whatzit can be as subtle or overt as your personality and the occasion permit.

Perhaps, unknowingly, you have fallen prey to this soon-tobe-legendary technique. At a gathering, have you ever noticed someone you would like to talk to? Then you’ve racked your brain to conjure an excuse to make the approach. What a bounty it was to discover that he or she was wearing some weird, wild, or wonderful something you could comment on.

#### Be a Whatzit Seeker, Too

Your business cards and your Whatzit are crucial socializing artifacts. Whether you are riding in the elevator, climbing the doorstep, or traversing the path to the party, make sure your Whatzit is hanging out for all to see.

> Technique 12.**Always Wear a Whatzit**
> 
> 
> Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your . . . what IS that?”

## How to meet the people you want to meet

If you strike out on finding something to comment on, resort to the Whoozat technique. Like a persistent politician, go to the party giver and say, “That man/woman over there looks interesting. Who is he/she?” Then ask for an introduction. Don’t be hesitant. The party giver will be pleased you find one of the guests interesting.

Suppose the party giver says, “Oh, that’s Joe Smith. I’m not sure what his job is, but I know he loves to ski.” Aha, you’ve just been given the icebreaker you need. Now you make a beeline for Joe Smith. “Hi, you’re Joe Smith, aren’t you? Susan was just telling me what a great skier you are. Where do you ski?” You get the idea.

> Technique 13.**Whoozat**
> 
> 
> 
> Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by nonpoliticians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers.

## How to break into a tight crowd

No obstacle blocks the resolute politician, who always has a
trick or ten up his or her sleeve. A politico would resort to the
“Eavesdrop In” technique. Eavesdropping, of course, conjures
images of clandestine activities—wiretapping, Watergate breakins, or spies skulking around in the murky shadows. Eavesdropping has historical precedent with politicians so, in a pinch, it
naturally comes to mind.

“I couldn’t help overhearing your discussion of Bermuda. I’m going there next month for the first time. Any suggestions?”

> Technique 14.**Eavesdrop In**
> 
> 
> No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear. . . .”
> 
> Will they be taken aback? Momentarily.
> 
> Will they get over it? Momentarily.
> 
> Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely!

## How to make "where are you from?" sound exciting

Do humanity and yourself a favor. Never, ever, give just a one sentence response to the question, “Where are you from?” Give the asker some fuel for his tank, some fodder for his trough. Give the hungry communicator something to conversationally nibble on. All it takes is an extra sentence or two about your city—some interesting fact, some witty observation—to hook the asker into the conversation.

> Technique 15.**Never the Naked City**
> 
> 
> 
> Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, “And where are you from?” never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one-word answer. Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that conversational partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think you’re a great conversationalist.

#### Different Bait for Shrimp or Sharks

A fisherman uses different bait to bag bass or bluefish. And you will obviously throw out different conversational bait to snag simple shrimp or sophisticated sharks. Your hook should relate to the type of person you’re speaking with.

At a social party of singles I’d opt for another answer. “I’m from Washington, D.C. The reason I left is there were seven women to every man when I was growing up.” Now the conversation can turn to the ecstasy or agony of being single, the perceived lack of desirable men everywhere, or even flirtatious possibilities.

In a political group, I’d cast a current fact from the constantly evolving political face of Washington. No need to speculate on the multitude of conversational possibilities that unlocks.

Where do you get your conversational bait? Start by phoning the chamber of commerce or historical society of your town. Search the World Wide Web and click on your town, or open an old-fashioned encyclopedia—all rich sources for future stimulating conversations. Learn some history, geography, business statistics, or perhaps a few fun facts to tickle future friends’ funny bones.

The Devlin debacle inspired further research. The minute I got home, I called the Columbus chamber of commerce and the historical society. Say you, too, are from Columbus, Ohio, and your new acquaintance lays it on you: “Where are you from?” When you are talking with a businessperson, your answer could be, “I’m from Columbus, Ohio. You know many major corporations do their product testing in Columbus because it’s so commercially typical. In fact, it’s been called ‘the most American city in America.’ They say if it booms or bombs in Columbus, it booms or bombs nationally.”

Talking with someone with a German last name? Tell her about Columbus’s historic German Village with the brick streets and the wonderful 1850s-style little houses. It’s bound to inspire stories of the old country. Your conversation partner’s surname is Italian? Tell him Genoa, Italy, is Columbus’s sister city.

The possibilities continue. You suspect your conversation partner has an artistic bent? “Ah,” you throw out casually, “Columbus is the home of artist George Bellows.”

## How to come out a winner every time they ask, "and what do you do?"

First, like Never the Naked City, don’t toss a short-shrift answer in response to the asker’s breathless inquiry. You leave the poor fish flopping on the deck when you just say your title: “I’m an actuary/an auditor/an author/an astrophysicist.” Have mercy so he or she doesn’t feel like a nincompoop outsider asking, “What, er, kind of actuizing (auditing, authoring, or astrophysizing) do you do?

You’re an attorney. Don’t leave it to laymen to try to figure out what you really do. Flesh it out. Tell a little story your conversation partner can get a handle on. For example, if you’re talking with a young mother say, “I’m an attorney. Our firm specializes in employment law. In fact, now I’m involved in a case where a company actually discharged a woman for taking extra maternity leave that was a medical necessity.” A mother can relate to that.

Talking with a business owner? Say “I’m an attorney. Our firm specializes in employment law. My current case concerns an employer who is being sued by one of her staff for asking personal questions during the initial job interview.” A business owner can relate to that.

> Technique 16.**Never the Naked Job**
> 
> 
> When asked the inevitable “And what do you do,” you may think “I’m an economist/an educator/an engineer” is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying “I’m a paleontologist/psychoanalyst/pornographer.” 
> 
> Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, they’ll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray.

#### Painful Memories of Naked Job Flashers

The chap on my other side announced, “I’m in industrial abrasives,” and then paused, waiting for me to be impressed. My “Well, er, golly, you must have to be a shrewd judge of character to be in industrial abrasives” didn’t fly either. We three sat in silence the rest of the meal.

## How to introduce people like the host(ess) with the most(est)

When they introduce people, they buy an insurance policy on the conversation with a few simple add-ons: “Susan, I’d like you to meet John. John has a wonderful boat we took a trip on last summer. John, this is Susan Smith. Susan is editor in chief of Shoestring Gourmet magazine.”

Padding the introduction gives Susan the opportunity to ask what kind of boat John has or where the group went. It gives John an opening to discuss his love of writing. Or of cooking. Or of food. The conversation can then naturally expand to travel in general, life on boats, past vacations, favorite recipes, restaurants, budgets, diets, magazines, editorial policy—to infinity.

> Technique 17.**Never the Naked Introduction**
> 
> 
> 
> When introducing people, don’t throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big clam, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then you’re free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity.

If you’re not comfortable mentioning someone’s job during the introduction, mention their hobby or even a talent.

## How to resuscitate a dying conversation

#### Be a Sleuth on Their Slips of the Tongue

Top communicators know ideas don’t come out of nowhere. If Mrs. Otis thought to bring up plants, then she must have some relationship with them. Furthermore, by mentioning the word, it meant subconsciously she wanted to talk about plants.

When talking with anyone, keep your ears open and, like a good detective, listen for clues. Be on the lookout for any unusual references: any anomaly, deviation, digression, or invocation of another place, time, person. Ask about it because it’s the clue to what your conversation partner would really enjoy discussing.

If two people have something in common, when the shared interest comes up, they jump on it naturally. For example, if someone mentions playing squash (bird-watching or stamp collecting) and the listener shares that passion, he or she pipes up, “Oh, you’re a squasher (or birder or philatelist), too!”

Here’s the trick: there’s no need to be a squasher, birder, or philatelist to pipe up with enthusiasm. You can simply “Be a Word Detective.” When you pick up on the reference as though it excites you, too, it parlays you into conversation the stranger thrills to.

> Technique 18.**Be a Word Detective**
> 
> Like a good gumshoe, listen to your conversation partner’s every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that’s hot for the other person.

---

## How to enthrall 'em with your choice of topic-them!

I told Dan about how pleased Diane was to meet him yet how little she learned about his life. Dan simply replied, “Well, when I meet someone, I learn so much more if I ask about their life. I always try to turn the spotlight on the other person.” Truly confident people often do this. They know they grow more by listening than talking. Obviously, they also captivate the talker.

#### Sell Yourself with a Top Sales Technique

Salespeople, this technique is especially crucial for you. Keep your “Swiveling Spotlight” **aimed away from you, only lightly on your product, and most brightly on your buyer.**

> Technique 19.**The Swiveling Spotlight**
> 
> 
> When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When you’re talking, the spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, it’s shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you.

## How to never need to wonder, "what do i say next"

Moments arise, of course, when even conversationalists extraordinaire hit the wall.

here’s a foolproof trick to get the fire blazing again. I call it “Parroting” after that beautiful tropical bird that captures everyone’s heart simply by repeating other people’s words.

Have you ever, puttering around the house, had the TV in the
background tuned to a tennis game? You hear the ball going back
and forth over the net—klink-klunk, klink-klunk, klink . . . this
time you don’t hear the klunk. The ball didn’t hit the court. What
happened? You immediately look up at the set

Likewise in conversation, the conversational ball goes back and
forth. First you speak, then your partner speaks, you speak . . . and
so it goes, back and forth. Each time, through a series of nods and
comforting grunts like “um hum,” or “umm,” you let your conversation partner know the ball has landed in your court. It’s your
“I got it” signal. Such is the rhythm of conversation.

#### "What Do I Say Next?"

Don’t panic. Instead of signaling verbally or nonverbally that you “got it,” simply repeat—or parrot—the last two or three words your companion said, in a sympathetic, questioning tone. That throws the conversational ball right back in your partner’s court.

After one especially exhausting trip some years ago, I flung my bags in his trunk and flopped onto the front seat. As I was dozing off, he mentioned he’d gone to the theater the night before. Usually I would have just grunted and wafted into unconsciousness. However, on this particular trip, I had learned the Parroting technique and was eager to try it. “Theater?” I parroted quizzically.

“Yes, it was a great show,” he replied, fully expecting it to be the last word on the subject before I fell into my usual sleepy stupor.

“Great show?” I parroted. Pleasantly surprised by my interest, he said, “Yes, it’s a new show by Stephen Sondheim called Sweeney Todd.”

“Sweeney Todd ?” I again parroted. Now Phil was getting fired up. “Yeah, great music and an unbelievably bizarre story. . . .”

I’m sure, to this day, Phil thinks of that trip as one of the best conversations we ever had. And all I did was parrot a few of his phrases.

> Technique 20.**Parroting**
> 
> 
> Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen.

#### Parroting Your Way to Profits

Parroting is also a can opener to pry open people’s real feelings. Star salespeople use it to get to their prospect’s emotional objections, which they often don’t even articulate to themselves.

Paul was walking around the lot with a prospect and his wife, who had expressed interest in a “sensible car.” 

Paul asked the husband what he thought of it. “Well,” he mused, “I’m not sure this car is right for me.” Instead of moving on to the next sensible car, Paul par roted “Right for you?” Paul’s questioning inflection signaled the prospect that he needed to say more.

“Well, er, yeah,” the prospect mumbled. “I’m not sure it fits my personality."

“Fits your personality?” Paul again parroted.

“You know, maybe I need something a little more sporty.”

“A little more sporty?” Paul parroted.

“Well, those cars over there look a little more sporty.”

Aha! Paul’s parrot had ferreted out which cars to show the customer. As they walked over toward a Lamborghini on the lot, Paul saw the prospect’s eyes light up. An hour later, Paul had pocketed a fat commission.

## How to get 'em happily chatting (so you can slip away if you want to!)

Every father smiles when his little tyke beseeches him at bedtime, “Daddy, Daddy, tell me the story again of the three little pigs” (or the dancing princesses or how you and Mommy met). Daddy knows Junior enjoyed the story so much the first time, he wants to hear it again and again.

Junior inspires the following technique called “Encore!” which serves two purposes. Encore! makes a colleague feel like a happy dad, and it’s a great way to give dying conversation a heart transplant.

#### Play It Again, Sam

“Encore!” is what appreciative audiences chant when they want another song from the singer, another dance from the dancer, another poem from the poet, and in my case, another storytelling from the officers. Encore! is the technique you can use to request a repeat story from a prospect, potential employer, or valued acquaintance. While the two of you are chatting with a group of people, simply turn to him and say, “John, I bet everyone would love to hear about the time you caught that thirty-pound striped bass.” Or, “Susan, tell everyone that story you just told me of how you rescued the kitten from the tree.” He or she will, of course, demure. Insist! Your conversation partner is secretly loving it. The subtext of your request is “That story of yours was so terrific, I want my other friends to hear it.” After all, only crowd pleasers are asked to do an Encore!

> Technique 21.**Encore!**
> 
> 
> The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is “Encore! Encore! Let’s hear it again!” The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people is “Tell them about the time you . . .”
> 
> Whenever you’re at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance.

The added benefit of this technique is that, once you’ve got them up and running with their conversation, you can sneak off and find more interesting company!

One word of warning: make sure the story you request is one in which the teller shines. No one wants to retell the time they lost the sale, cracked up the car, or broke up the bar and spent the night in jail. Make sure your requested Encore! is a positive story where they come out the big winner, not the buffoon.

## How to come across as a positive person

Often people think when they meet someone they like, they should share a secret, reveal an intimacy, or make a confession of sorts to show they are human too. Airing your youthful battle with bed-wetting, teeth grinding, or thumb sucking—or your present struggle with gout or a goiter—supposedly endears you to the masses.

> Technique 22.**Ac-cen-tu-ate the Pos-i-tive**
> 
> 
> When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s the time, as the old song says, to “ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive.”

---

## How to always have something interesting to say

The best way to ensure you’re conversationally in the swing of things is to listen to a newscast just before you leave. What’s happening right now in the world—all the fires, floods, air disasters, toppled governments, and stock market crashes—pulverizes into great conversational fodder, no matter what crowd you’re circulating in.

> Technique 23.**The Latest News . . . Don’t Leave Home Without It**
> 
> The last move to make before leaving for the party even after you’ve given yourself final approval in the mirror—is to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your mouth by asking what everybody’s talking about. Foot-in-mouth is not very tasty in public, especially when it’s surrounded by egg-on-face.
