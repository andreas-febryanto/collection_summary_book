# Part 5: How To Sound Like You're Peas In a Pod: "Why, We're Just Alike!"

If you squint your eyes and look up carefully at a flight of birds, you’ll see finches flying with finches, swallows soaring with swallows, and yellow birds winging it with yellow birds. The avian apartheid escalates. You’ll never see a barn swallow with a bank swallow, or even a yellow bird hanging out with a yellow finch. Somebody said it shorter: Birds of a feather flock together.

It has been proven beyond a doubt, people are most receptive to those they feel have the same values in life. In one study individuals were first given a personality and beliefs test. They were then paired off with a partner and told to go spend time together. Before meeting, half the couples were told they were very similar in beliefs to their partner. The other half were told they were dissimilar. Neither statement was true.

However, when quizzed afterward on how much they liked each other, partners who believed they were similar liked each other a lot more than the couples who thought themselves to be dissimilar, demonstrating we have a predisposition toward people we believe are just like us. We are most comfortable giving our business and friendship to those we feel share our values and beliefs in life.

## How to Make Them Fell You're of the Same "Class"

> Technique 44.**Be a Copyclass**
> 
> Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy?
> 
> Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the style of movement. That makes your conversation partner subliminally real comfy with you.

#### They're Buying You, Too

If you’re in sales, copy not only your customer’s class but the class of your product as well.

Match your personality to your product. Selling handmade suits? A little decorum please. Selling jeans? A little cool, please. Selling sweat suits? A little sporty, please. And so on for whatever you’re selling. Remember, you are your customers’ buying experience. Therefore you are part of the product they’re buying.

## How to Make Them Feel That You're Like "Family"

Lovers call it “chemistry.” New friends talk of “instant rapport,” and businesspeople say a “meeting of minds.” Yet it’s the same magic, that sudden sense of warmth and closeness, that strange sensation of “Wow, we were old friends at once!”

When we were children, making friends was easier. Most of the kids we met grew up in the same town and so they were on our wavelength. Then the years went by. We grew older. We moved away. Our backgrounds, our experiences, our goals, our lifestyles became diverse. Thus, we fell off each other’s wavelengths.

#### It All Started Across the Ocean

Family members find themselves speaking alike. Friends use the same words, and associates in a company or members in a club talk alike. Everyone you meet will have his or her own language that subliminally distinguishes them from outsiders. The words are all English, but they vary from area to area, industry to industry, and even family to family.

#### The Linguistic Device That Says "We're on the Same Wavelength"

When you want to give someone the subliminal feeling you’re just alike, use their words, not yours. Suppose you are selling a car to a young mother who tells you she is concerned about safety because she has a young “toddler.” When explaining the safety features of the car, use her word. Don’t use whatever word you call your kids. Don’t even say child-protection lock, which was in your sales manual. Tell your prospect, “No toddler can open the window because of the driver’s control device.” Even call it a toddlerprotection lock. When Mom hears toddler coming from your lips, she feels you are “family” because that’s how all her relatives refer to her little tyke. Suppose your prospect had said kid or infant. Fine, echo any word she used. (Well, almost any word. If she’d said my brat, you might want to pass on Echoing this time.)

#### Echoing at Parties

Let’s say you are at a party. It’s a huge bash with many different types of people. You are first chatting with a lawyer who tells you her profession is often maligned. When it comes your turn to speak, say profession too. If you say job, it puts a subconscious barrier between you.

Next you meet a construction worker who starts talking about his job. Now you’re in trouble if you say, “Well, in my profession . . .” he’d think you were being hoity-toity.

> Technique 45.**Echoing**
> Echoing is a simple linguistic technique that packs a powerful wallop. Listen to the speaker’s arbitrary choice of nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives—and echo them back. Hearing their words come out of your mouth creates subliminal rapport. It makes them feel you share their values, their attitudes, their interests, their experiences.

## How to Really Make It Clear to Them

#### On-Target Analogies Hit Bull's-Eye

Analogies can be an effective communications tool—if you evoke images from the life of the person you are talking to. Men don’t use football analogies to obfuscate matters or to confuse women but to clarify situations for each other. Analogies from the sport bring situations to life for men because generally they watch more football than women.

> Technique 46.**Potent Imaging**
> Does your customer have a garden? Talk about “sowing the seeds for success.” Does your boss own a boat? Tell him or her about a concept that will “hold water” or “stay afloat.” Maybe he is a private pilot? Talk about a concept really “taking off.” She plays tennis? Tell her it really hits the “sweet spot.”
> 
> Evoke your listener’s interests or lifestyle and weave images around it. To give your points more power and punch, use analogies from your listener’s world, not your own. Potent Imaging also tells your listeners you think like them and hints you share their interests.

## How to Make Them Feel You Emphathize (Without Just Saying "Yep, Uh Huh, Yeah")

#### What Are Empathizers?

Empathizers are simple, short, supportive statements. Unlike “uh huh,” they are complete sentences such as “I can appreciate you decided to do that,” or “That really is exciting.” Empathizers can be one-sentence positive critiques like “Yes, that was the honorable thing to do,” or “It’s charming you felt that way.”

> Technique 47.**Employ Empathizers**
> Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like “I see what you mean.” Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like “That’s a lovely thing to say.” Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue.

## How to Make Them THink You See/Hear/Feel It Just the Way They Do

#### A Simple Solution

“Anatomically Correct Empathizers,” and it’s easy to master. Unless it is obvious the person you are speaking with is primarily visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, simply respond in his or her mode of the moment. Match your empathizers to the current sense someone is talking through. For example, suppose a business colleague describing a financial plan says, “With this plan, we can see our way clear in six months.” Since this time she’s using primarily visual references, say “I see what you mean” or “You really have a clear picture of that situation.”

If, instead, your colleague had said, “This plan has a good ring to it,” you’d substitute auditory empathizers like “It does sound great,” or “I hear you.”

A third possibility. Suppose she had said, “I have a gut feeling this plan will work.” Now you give her a kinesthetic empathizer like “I can understand how you feel,” or “You have a good grasp of that problem.”

> Technique 48.**Anatomically Correct Empathizers**
> 
> What part of their anatomy are your associates talking through? Their eyes? Their ears? Their gut?
> 
> For visual people, use visual empathizers to make them think you see the world the way they do. For auditory folks, use auditory empathizers to make them think you hear them loud and clear. For kinesthetic types, use kinesthetic empathizers to make them think you feel the same way they do.

## How to Make 'Em Think We (Instead of You vs. Me)

How? A fascinating progression of conversation unfolds as
people become closer. Here’s how it develops:

#### Level One: Cliches

Two strangers talking together primarily toss clichés back and forth. For instance, when chatting about the universally agreedupon world’s dullest subject—the weather—one stranger might say to the other, “Beautiful sunny weather we’ve been having.” Or, “Boy, some rain, huh?” That’s level one, clichés.

#### Level Two: Facts

People who know each other but are just acquaintances often discuss facts. “You know, Joe, we’ve had twice as many sunny days this year to date as last.” Or, “Yeah, well, we finally decided to put in a swimming pool to beat the heat.”

#### Level Three: Feelings and Personal Questions

When people become friends, they often express their feelings to each other, even on subjects as dull as the weather. “George, I just love these sunny days.” They also ask each other personal questions: “How about you, Betty? Are you a sun person?”

#### Level Four: We Statements

Now we progress to the highest level of intimacy. This level is richer than facts and creates more rapport than feelings. It’s we and us statements. Friends discussing the weather might say, “If we keep having this good weather, it’ll be a great summer.” Lovers might say, “I hope this good weather keeps up for us so we can go swimming on our trip.”

A technique to achieve the ultimate verbal intimacy grows out of this phenomenon. Simply use the word we prematurely. You can use it to make a client, a prospect, a stranger feel you are already friends. Use it to make a potential romantic partner feel the two of you are already an item. I call it the “Premature We.” In casual conversation, simply cut through levels one and two. Jump straight to three and four.

The word we fosters togetherness. It makes the listener feel connected. It gives a subliminal feeling of “you and me against the cold, cold world.” When you prematurely say we or us, even to strangers, it subconsciously brings them closer. It subliminally hints you are already friends.

> Technique 49.**The Premature WE**
> Create the sensation of intimacy with someone even if you’ve met just moments before. Scramble the signals in their psyche by skipping conversational levels one and two and cutting right to levels three and four. Elicit intimate feelings by using the magic words we, us, and our.

## How to Create a Friendly "Private Joke" with Them

> Technique 50.**Instant History**
> When you meet a stranger you’d like to make less a stranger, search for some special moment you shared during your first encounter. Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh, the warm smile, the good feelings the two of you felt. Now, just like old friends, you have a history together, an Instant History. 
> 
> With anyone you’d like to make part of your personal or professional future, look for special moments together. Then make them a refrain.

The next day, my phone rang. I picked up the receiver to hear, not “Hello, this is Daryl,” but simply, “Quack.” I’m sure that’s what started our friendship. To this day, every time I hear his “Quack” on the phone, it floods me with happy, if a tad embarrassing, memories. It recalls our history and renews our friendship no matter how long it’s been since we last quacked at each other.
