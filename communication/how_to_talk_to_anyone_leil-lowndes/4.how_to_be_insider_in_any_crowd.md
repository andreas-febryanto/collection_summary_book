# Part 4: How To Be An Insider In Any Crowd

#### What Are They All Talking About

Has it ever happened to you? Everyone at the party is speaking gobbledygook. They’re all discussing faulty audits, code constraints, or the library market—and you have no idea what they’re talking about. It’s because everybody at the party is an accountant, an architect, or a publisher—and you’re not.

We grown-up boys and girls also have our favorite topics that usually involve our work or our hobbies. When we’re with people in our own field or who share our interests, we open up like small-town gossips. (Even engineers who have a constant case of cat-got their-tongue start gabbing about greasy turbines and various projects when they’re together.) To outsiders, our conversation sounds like gobbledygook. But we know precisely what it’s about. It’s our own jobbeldygook or hobbydygook.

Just as anglers throw out a dragonfly to get the fish to bite, all you have to do is throw out the right questions to get people to open up. Dale Carnegie’s adage, “show sincere interest and people will talk,” only goes so far. As they say in poker, “it takes jacks or better to open.” And in conversation, it takes cursory knowledge or better about their field to get them to really open up. You must have knowledgeable curiosity, the kind that makes you sound like you’re worth talking to.

## How to Be a Modern-Day Renaissance Man or Woman

Most Big Apple subway riders know only two things about the subway: where they get on and where they get off. They know nothing about the rest of the system. Most people are like NYC strap-hangers when it comes to their hobbies and interests. They know their own pastimes, but all the others are like unvisited stations.

My unmarried (and wishing she weren’t) friend Rita has a bad case of bowler’s thumb. Every Wednesday night she’s bowling up a storm with her friends. She is forever discussing her scores, her averages, and her high game. Another single and searching friend Walter is into white-water rafting. He talks endlessly with his paddling friends about which rivers he’s run, which outfitters he’s gone with, and which class rapids he prefers. Thinking my two single friends might hit it off, I introduced Walter the paddler to Rita the bowler and mentioned their respective passions.

“Oh you’re a bowler!” said Walter.

“Yes,” Rita smiled demurely, awaiting more questions about her big bowling turn-on. Walter was silent.

Masking her disappointment, Rita said, “Uh, Leil tells me you’re into water rafting.” Walter smiled proudly, awaiting further friendly interrogation on paddling. “Uh, that must be exciting. Isn’t it dangerous?” was the best Rita could do.

“No, it’s not dangerous,” Walter patronizingly responded to her typical outsider’s question. Then the conversation died.

During the deafening silence, I remember thinking, if Rita had run just one river, if Walter had bowled just one game, their lives might be different now. Conversation could have flowed, and who knows what else might have flowered.

#### Go Fly a Kite!

The “Scramble Therapy” technique is salvation from such disappointing encounters.

Scramble Therapy is, quite simply, scrambling up your life and participating in an activity you’d never think of indulging in. Just one out of every four weekends, do something totally out of your pattern.

If you take a piece of blue litmus paper and dip it in a huge vat of acid, the tip turns pink. If you take another blue litmus paper and dip it into just one minuscule drop of acid on a glass slide, the tip turns just as pink. Compare this to participating in an activity just one time. A sampling gives you 80 percent of the conversational value. You learn the insider’s questions to ask. You start using the right terms. You’ll never be at a loss again when the subject of extracurricular interests comes up—which it always does.

> Technique 38.**Scramble Therapy**
> Once a month, scramble your life. Do something you’d never dream of doing. Participate in a sport, go to an exhibition, hear a lecture on something totally out of your experience. You get 80 percent of the right lingo and insider questions from just one exposure.

Think about it! Suppose at a dinner party, the table conversation turns to scuba diving. If you, too, had done your one-timeonly dive, you’d ask your diving dinner companion if he likes night diving or whether he prefers diving on wrecks or reefs. (He’ll never believe it when you tell him the deepest water you’ve ever submerged yourself in is your own bathtub.)

## How to Sound Like You Know All About Their Job or Hobby

All you need are a few insider opening questions to get you started with any group. You ask questions, listen to the responses, and indulge in elementary on-target conversation with them for a moment or two about their field. (Then change the subject ASAP! You don’t want to fake you are more knowledgeable about their field than you really are.)

#### It's All in the Opening Question

A tennis player can tell immediately from just appraising your opening serve how good a player you are. Is it going to be great playing with you or a real bore? It’s the same in communicating. Just from your verbal opening serve, someone knows if it’s going to be interesting talking with you about their life or interests—or dull, dull, dull.

For example, suppose I’m introduced to someone and the first words out of her mouth are, “Oh, you’re a writer. When are you going to write the great American novel?” Yikes, I know I’m talking with someone who is unfamiliar with my world. We’ll chat, but I prefer to change the subject. And soon, my conversation partner.

If, however, my new acquaintance says, “Oh you’re a writer. Do you write fiction or nonfiction?” Bingo! Now I know I’m with a person who knows about my world. Why? Because that is the first question all writers ask each other. I enjoy talking to this inquisitor because I presume she has more insights into the writing world. Even if we quickly get off the subject of writing, she has come across as a well-informed individual.

Every job, every sport, every interest has insider opening questions that everybody in the same field asks—and its dumb outsider questions that they never ask each other. When an astronaut meets another astronaut, he asks, “What missions have you been on?” (Never “How do you go to the bathroom up there?”) A dentist asks another dentist, “Are you in general practice or do you have a specialty?” (Never “Heard any good pain jokes lately?”)

#### "Help! Everybody There Will Be an Artist"

It’s not hard to harvest good Jobbledygook. Let’s say you’ve been invited to a gallery opening where you’ll be meeting many artists. If you don’t speak artist, go through your Rolodex to see if you have an artist friend or two.

Aha, you found one. Well, sort of. Your friend Sally attended art school. You call her up and ask, “Sally, I know this sounds silly but I’ve been invited to an event where I’m bound to be talking with a lot of artists. Could you give me a few good questions to ask?” Sally might find your query a tad unusual, but your diligence should impress her.

```
Maybe she’ll say, “Well, ask artists what medium they work in.”
“Medium?” you ask.
“Sure,” she’ll tell you. “That’s the insider’s way to ask if they
work with acrylics, oil, charcoal, pen, and so forth.”
“Oh.”
“Don’t ask artists to describe their work,” she warns. “They
feel theirs is a visual medium that can’t be described.”
“Oh.”
“And don’t ask them if their work is in a gallery.”
“Oh?”
```

“That could be a sore point. Instead ask ‘Is there anyplace I might see your work?’ They’ll love that because, even if they’re not represented by a gallery, they can invite you to their studio to possibly buy their work.”

> Big winners speak Jobbledygook as a second language. What is Jobbledygook? It’s the language of other professions.
> 
> Why speak it? It makes you sound like an insider.
> 
> How do you learn it? You’ll find no Jobbledygook cassettes in the language section of your bookstore, but the lingo is easy to pick up. Simply ask a friend who speaks the lingo of the crowd you’ll be with to teach you a few opening questions. The words are few and the rewards are manifold.

## How to Bare Their Hot Button (Elementary Doc-Talk)

My friend John, a physician, recently married a charming Japanese woman, Yamika. John told me the first time they were invited to a party to meet many of John’s colleagues, Yamika was panicstricken. She wanted to make a good impression, yet she was tense about talking to American doctors. John was the only one she’d ever met, and during their romance they didn’t spend a whole lot of time discussing medicine.

John told her, “Don’t worry about it, Yami. They all ask each other the same old questions. When you meet them, just ask, ‘What’s your specialty’ and ‘Are you affiliated with a hospital?’

“Then, to get into deeper conversation,” he continued, “throw out questions like ‘How’s your relationship with your hospital?’ or ‘How’s the current medical environment affecting you?’ These are hot issues with doctors because everything’s changing in health care.”

John said Yamika delivered the lines verbatim. She circulated the party asking the various doctors’ specialties and inquiring about their affiliations and relationships with their hospitals. As a result, she was the hit of the party. Many of John’s colleagues later congratulated him on having found such a charming and insightful woman.

#### Getting the Real Grabber

It’s not just doctors. Every profession has concerns that are all the buzz within the industry. The rest of the world, however, knows little about these fixations. For example, independent booksellers constantly complain that big superstore chains are taking over the industry. Accountants lie awake nights worrying about liability insurance for faulty audits. And dentists grind their teeth over OSHA and EPA regulations. Oh, us writers, too. We’re always bellyaching about magazines not paying us for electronic rights to our precious words.

> Technique 40.**Baring Their Hot Button**
> 
> Before jumping blindly into a bevy of bookbinders or a drove of dentists, find out what the hot issues are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those buttons.

#### See You at the Big One!

While you’re at it, don’t forget to grill your informant for special insider greetings to use when you’re with their gang. For example, actresses cringe if they hear “good luck” before a show, but they smile at well-wishers who say “Break a leg!

“Break a leg,” however, is not appropriate for runners before a marathon. That’s the last thought they want to have! The only thing they want to break is their personal record. Try “Have a personal best!”

Firefighters who work on shift seldom see each other except, of course, at the biggest blazes. Thus the firefighters’ greeting “See ya at the big one!”

## How to secretly Learn About Their Lives

Using outsider words is one of the biggest giveaways that you are not in the know. On the ship, if a passenger asked any of my staff, “How long have you been working on the boat?” they’d squelch a groan. Cruise staffers proudly worked on a ship, and the word boat revealed the passenger as a real landlubber.

The right word can perform conversational miracles. In the receiving line, whenever passengers asked our laconic captain, “When did you first become a master?” or “What was your first command?” he would hold up the entire line of people snaking around the ballroom waiting to shake his hand. Captain Cafiero would enthusiastically recount his naval history to the savvy inquirer who might have just learned the words master or command last week in the newspaper shipping notices. (If the passenger had simply said, “How long have you been a captain?” or “What was your first boat?” he or she would have gotten the captain’s usual Italian gentleman’s version of the bum’s rush.)

> Technique 41.**Read Their Rags**
> Is your next big client a golfer, runner, swimmer, surfer, or skier? Are you attending a social function filled with accountants or Zen Buddhists—or anything in between? There are untold thousands of monthly magazines serving every imaginable interest. You can dish up more information than you’ll ever need to sound like an insider with anyone just by reading the rags that serve their racket. (Have you read your latest copy of Zoonooz yet?)

## How to Talk Them into Getting the "Insider's Price" (on Practically Anything You Buy)

Principled technique called “Bluffing for Bargains.” It was born one afternoon sitting with an insurance broker Mr. Carson. Carson was a smooth operator and he was patiently explaining to me in layman’s terms the benefits of certain riders he was pushing.

A little bit of knowledge goes a long way when you’re buying something. If you have insight into your real estate broker’s bottom line, he’s more apt to give you the better price. If you are facile with the insider words caterers and car salesmen use to pad their profits, if you’re savvy to techniques moving companies and mechanics use to bilk the unsuspecting, if you are on the lookout for lawyers’ methods of fattening fees—in short, if you know the ropes, you will not get ripped off. You don’t need to know a lot, just a few insider terms. The pro assumes, since you are conversant in some esoteric industry terms, you also know the best deal and rock-bottom price.

#### How to Deal When There's No Iggy In Your Life

Here’s how to get the best price and the best deal from anyone. Find your Iggy Informer. If you have a friend in the business, get the lingo from him. If not, instead of going straight to the vendor you want to buy from, visit several others first. Talk with them. Learn a little lingo from each.

For instance, suppose you want to buy a diamond. Instead of going right to your favorite jewelry shop and asking dumbbell diamond questions, go to the competition. Make friends with the salesclerk and pick up a few gems of diamondese. You’ll learn jewelers say stones, not diamonds. When you’re talking about the top of the stone, they say table; the widest part is the girdle; the bottom is the cutlet. If the stone looks yellow, don’t say yellow, say cape. If you see flaws, don’t say flaws, say inclusions or gletz. If you still don’t like the stone, don’t say “I’d like to see something better,” say finer. (Don’t ask me why. That’s just the way the diamond crowd talks.)

> Technique 43.**Bluffing for Bargains**
> 
> The haggling skills used in ancient Arab markets are alive and well in contemporary America for big-ticket items. Your price is much lower when you know how to deal.
> 
> Before every big purchase, find several vendors—a few to learn from and one to buy from. Armed with a few words of industryese, you’re ready to head for the store where you’re going to buy.
