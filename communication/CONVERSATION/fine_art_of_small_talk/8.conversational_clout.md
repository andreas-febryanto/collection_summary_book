# Conversational Clout

I do propose that you use assertive, rather than passive, language. Be aware when you use the following examples and notice how you project yourself in the course of conversation.

> - When will that be ready?Put yourself in the driver’s seat.
>   Instead:Will you please have that ready for me by Tuesday?
> 
> - I’d hate to direct you to the wrong store.Hate to do what? Hate to make a mistake?
>   Instead:I do not know what store to direct you to.Or, I believe that you can find that product at 
> 
> - I was going to say that property taxes seem highand I would think that roses would require more sunshine than this space provides.This qualifies what you are about to say. Either statement sounds cautious and timid.
>   Instead:I believe property taxes are highor From my experience, roses require more sunshine than is provided in this space.
> 
> - Can I interrupt you for a minute?  Can I ask you a question? You already have! If you are willing to interrupt someone when they are engaged, just ask the question! But to be polite, you could offer I’m sorry to interrupt…and then ask your question.
> 
> - I’ll have to ask someone about that…Who are you? No one?
>   Instead:I’ll be glad to check with accounting and get back to you.
> 
> - I’ll be honest with you, I had a great time!Aren’t you always honest? Are you qualifying this particular statement over others you have made?
>   Instead:I had a great time!
> 
> - Can you spell your name for me?Most of us know how to spell our names, we do not need to be asked first if we know how!
>   
>   Instead:Please spell your name for me.
> 
> - If I can find out…A low expectation is established when you use the word if. Raise expectations. Instill confidence.
>   Instead:I will look into this and get back to you one way or the other.
> 
> - I’m only the…Everyone’s role or job is important. This is demeaning to oneself. Define the capabilities and responsibilities in your area of expertise.
>   Instead:My responsibilities are focused on website development. I will be glad to check with sales about your order.
> 
> - I can’t meet with you this morning. This projects an unwillingness to deliver the best possible outcome. Or it projects a burden. Tell them what you can do.
>   Instead:I can be there by three this afternoon.
> 
> - I’ll try to get this back to you this week.The word tryconveys the underlying message that this is not something that is dependable.
>   Instead:I’ll get to you no later than next week.Tell people what you will do, not what you hope to do.
> 
> - I’ll have to…Another burden. I’ll have to check with my husbandor I’ll have to check with my team
>   Instead:I’ll be glad to check with my husbandand I’ll be glad to speak to my team and get back to you
> 
> - You’ll have to call me tomorrow. This is a busy time for me.This sounds like a person giving orders and placing another burden on my already heavy load! And I don’t like to be bossed around.
>   Instead:You can call me tomorrow. That’s a better time for me.
> 
> - I’m really not too sure.Yes, you are sure. You are sure you don’t know!
>   Instead:I don’t know how to get to Colfax. Ask Jennifer. She is good with directions.
> 
> - May I ask your name?Permission is not necessary to ask someone’s name!
>   Instead:What is your name
