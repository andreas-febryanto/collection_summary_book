# Let's Give 'Em Something to Talk About

## It's All in the Asking

**By asking open-ended questions, you offer your conversation partner the opportunity to disclose as much or as little as she wants.**

## Open-Ended Questions

- Describe for me…

- Tell me about…

- How did you…?

- What was that like for you?

- What brought you to…?

- Why?

My kids come through the door at the end of the day, and I ask, How was your day at school? In stereo, I get back, Fine. Instead of considering that a dead end, I follow up with another question. I inquire, What did you like about it today

My teenage son usually says, I don’t know. I look him right in the eye and tell him, Really, tell me about one class you liked today. He thinks about it for a minute. Finally he says, Science. And I inquire, What did you like about science? He launches into a colorful description of an experiment they did, and we’re talking. **The bottom line is that you have to open it up, and you have to show you truly care.**

## Digging Deeper

Every Monday in offices across the country people ask each other, How was your weekend?

These everyday inquiries are just a few other ways of saying hello. It’s almost universally understood that these questions are a form of greeting, not a sincere inquiry.

Most of the time the conversation ends immediately after a brief exchange. I ask my husband, Steve, How was your day? He replies, Great. The conversation evaporates—not because there was no place to go with it but **because of a lack of follow-up**. My husband doesn’t think I really care about his day unless I ask more. I invite conversation by saying, What made it so great? What went on for you today?

Whenever you begin a dialogue with a question, get ready to dig deeper so that the other person knows you are interested in hearing more.  **Digging in deeper indicates you truly desire a response and are prepared to invest time in hearing the response.**

Here are some new ways to ask old favorites:

| Instead of Asking:            | Try This:                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are you married ?             | Tell me about your family.                                                   |
| What do you do for a living ? | Tell me about your business/work.                                            |
| Do you have kids ?            | Tell me about your family.                                                   |

## Free for the Taking

When you invite someone to tell you about his family or her job, you will receive additional free information that you can use to further the conversation.
Stay focused on responses for any details or free information that you can use to keep the conversation going.

###### Team apparel and other logo-identified clothing, accessories, water bottles, and clipboards

Are great conversation starters. Be observant for a new hairdo, a book or magazine, a child’s artwork, or a cast on a broken limb.

###### Office and home decorare.

are small-talk opportunities waiting to happen

###### Location, location, location and occasion, occasion, occasion.

The location and occasion of an event offer a wide variety of free information. At a wedding: I was the bride’s college roommate. How do you know the couple?At a seminar or convention, simply asking What brought you to this event? is an easy and unobtrusive way to start a conversation.

###### Behavior

If you are observant, you’ll get a lot of free information from people’s behavior. The way they speak and write can offer you small-talk starters. Notice if they are left-handed.

## Fake it Till You Make it

You’ll become skilled at small talk the same way you’ve improved in other activities—practice.
