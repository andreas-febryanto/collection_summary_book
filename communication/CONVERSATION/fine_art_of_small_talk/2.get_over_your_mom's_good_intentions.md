# Get Over Your Mom's Good Intentions

When we were impressionable toddlers, our parents taught us:

- Don’t talk to strangers.

- Wait to be properly introduced.

- Silence is golden.

- Good things come to those who wait.

Those messages served us well as kids; the advice helped ensure our safety and taught us manners. But now, as adults, our safety isn’t at stake with every new person we meet! And by now our manners are well established. The time has come to replace those old messages with more relevant advice.

## Introduce Yourself

I think most of us can relate to the following poem, author unknown:

> ###### Thoughts from a New Member
> 
> I see you at the meetings,
> but you never say hello.
> You’re busy all the time you’re there
> with those you really know.
> I sit among the members,
> yet I’m a lonely gal.
> The new ones feel as strange as I;
> the old ones pass us by.
> Darn it, you folks urged us to join
> and talked of fellowship,
> You could just cross the room, you know,
> but you never make the trip.
> Can’t you just nod your head and smile
> or stop and shake a hand,
> Then go sit among your friends?
> Now that I’d understand.
> I’ll be at your next meeting,
> and hope that you will spend
> The time to introduce yourself,
> I joined to be your friend.

At your next opportunity to spend time at a reception, coffee break, hospitality suite, or wedding, look around the room. Find that approachable person and include him or her in conversation. Chances are, that person is feeling as alone as you are.

## Good Thigs Come To Those Who Go Get Them

Think like NBA superstar Michael Jordan: “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

Good things come to those who take action and start creating good things.

One of my all-time favorite ways to launch a conversation in a business or social setting and get to know someone is to ask one of the many iterations of What keeps you busy?It is an excellent query that does not pigeonhole others based on what they do for a living, if they are married, or if they have children. No labels; instead, sincere interest in how she spends her time, allowing for numerous directions in conversation. Your conversation partner discloses whatever she chooses.

A wonderful way to get to know someone at a professional setting is to ask: What keeps you busy outside of work?You will learn that your customer, colleague, stakeholder, or manager may have an array of responses.

The responses are infinite, including recreational, community oriented, religious, intellectual, family, and social activities.

> A variation of this that I will routinely use in professional settings is: What do you do for fun
