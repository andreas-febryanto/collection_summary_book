# Prevent Pregnant Pauses With Preparation

Even with icebreakers, conversation-makers, and active listening, there are still times when the conversation can grind to a halt if you’re not prepared.

Here are a few foolproof ideas:

> ###### Jump Starters
> 
> - Did anyone happen to catch that special playoff game last night?
> 
> - Have any of you seen the film…?
> 
> - I just finished reading . Has anyone read it yet?
> 
> - Have any of you heard of that new app?
> 
> - Will someone explain cryptocurrency to me?
> 
> - Does anyone here have a (bank, hair stylist, stockbroker, etc.) they could recommend?
> 
> - How has Zoom impacted your world?
> 
> - Tell me about love in your life…

A favorite jump starter before a virtual meeting is called to order is, Where are you today?Working from home is a new normal. However, home can be in a childhood home, a shared workspace, an entirely different city or town thanks to the quickly changing landscape of work.

## Don't Let Old Acquiaintance Be Forgotten

Without asking So what’s new?, a question that begs the conversation-stopping answerNot much, seek out what’s new and keep the conversation rolling with questions like these:

> ###### With Acquiaintances Use
> 
> - Bring me up to date on…
> 
> - What’s been going on with work since I last saw you?
> 
> - hat has changed in your life since we spoke last?
> 
> - Bring me up to date on your child’s post-high school plans…
> 
> - How’s your year been?
> 
> - What’s new with the family?
> 
> - Catch me up on the project…
> 
> ###### With Acquiaintances Don't Use
> 
> - How’s your wife/husband/partner/spouse?
> 
> - How’s your job at…?
> 
> - Did your daughter get asked to prom?
> 
> - How are the wedding plans going?
> 
> - Any babies in the future?
> 
> - What are your child’s college plans?
> 
> - Did she graduate?

## Getting a History Lesson

Do your part to charge up the conversation by being prepared with questions on the origin and history of those people you are with. For instance, you can inquire:

> ###### History Lessons
> 
> - How did you two meet?
> 
> - How did you get started ?
> 
> - What got you interested in this area?
> 
> - When did you first know you wanted to be a ?
> 
> - What brought you to Colorado?
> 
> - How do you all know each other?
> 
> - What got you interested in marketing?
> 
> - What gave you the idea for this business?
> 
> - What happened first?

## Preparing for The Long Haul

It takes much less effort to prepare for a conversation than a job interview, but the philosophy is the same. You want to have material prepared that is relevant to the event or interaction so that you can converse articulately and gracefully. I call the questions that fall into this category “interviewing questions”

> ###### Interviewing Questions
> 
> - What word would you say describes you best?
> 
> - Do you have a personal mottoor creed?
> 
> - Do you have any heroes that you greatly admire?
> 
> - What did people in high school think you were like?
> 
> - What’s on your bucket list?
> 
> - If you could go back to your teenage self, what would your advice be?
> 
> - What two things can you not live without?
> 
> - What are you most proud of?
> 
> - What is the number one ingredient to your success? What is your secret sauce?
> 
> - What do you do that you wish you could stop doing?

## The Perfect Compliment

You can compliment someone on a new hairstyle, an item of clothing, a piece of jewelry, or physical appearance. However, not all compliments are created equal. A good compliment acknowledges the object of admiration: That’s a nice sweater you’re wearingor What an unusual tie. An excellent, top-of-the-line compliment goes beyond that to give conversation materialby expounding on why you like the item.

For instance, you might elaborate on the sweater by saying, I love your sweater. That shade really enhances the color of your eyes.

> ###### Behavioral Compliments
> 
> - I appreciate how organized you are for our meetings. It makes it easy to get the work done.
> 
> - It must have taken a lot of courage to change careers during your peak of success. I really admire that.
> 
> - You have an amazing amount of determination. I think it’s remarkable that you set aside time to successfully train for a marathon. Congratulations.
> 
> - I know you are nervous about this procedure; it’s great that you made yourself show up.
> 
> - You certainly look at the bright side of things; it is a pleasure to work with you.
> 
> - You manage to run such an organized home, even with four children!



## Adding Form and Substance

I use the acronym FORM:

- ###### Family
  
  Tell me about your family. Does everyone live in the area? What do you like best about being a father/mother/son/aunt, et cetera?

- ###### Occupation
  
  What got you into your current job? How did you come up with that idea?What are some of the toughest challenges in your work? If you could change one thing about your job, what would it be?How has social media impacted your business/industry?

- ###### Recreation
  
  What do you do for fitness? What kinds of things does your family do for fun?How do you spend your leisure time? What’s been your favorite vacation?

- ###### Miscellaneous
  
  Have you seen any good movies lately? What do you think about [news event]? Are you reading anything you really enjoy
