# Take The Plunge: Start a Conversation !

The rules are simple. When someone gives you a smile, you are naturally inclined to smile back. Be the first to smile and greet another person. **Just a smile and a few words, and it’s done. Be sure that you make eye contact.**

## Nix the Nicknames

If a colleague introduces himself as “Michael,” don’t call him “Mike.” If he wanted you to call him “Mike,” he would have introduced himself that way. If someone has a difficult name, make the effort to learn it—do not shorten it to a nickname without permission! It makes me crazy when someone shortens my name to “Debbie.”
