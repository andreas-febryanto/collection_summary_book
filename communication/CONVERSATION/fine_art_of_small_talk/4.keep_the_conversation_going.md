# Keep the Conversation Going !

Not only are icebreakers a good way to start a conversation, but some of the statements are accompanied by questions you can ask to keep the ball rolling. Don’t use a statement alone. 

Using a statement by itself is like lobbing the conversational ball blindfolded, not knowing where it will land or whether it will get tossed back. 

For example, enthusiastic exclamations like What a beautiful day, or That was a great show, or Long meeting are indirect invitations to chat. **Better to be direct, so there is no doubt you are starting a dialogue**. Try these:

> - What a beautiful day. What’s your favorite season of the year?
> 
> - I was truly touched by that movie. How did you like it? Why?
> 
> - Gas prices are high. When was the last time you had to fill your tank?
> 
> - This is a wonderful restaurant. What is your favorite restaurant? Why?
> 
> - What a great conference! Tell me about the sessions you attended.
> 
> - I was absent last week. What did I miss?
> 
> - Commuting to work has become a huge stressor. What’s it like for you
> 
> - That was an interesting program after lunch. What did you think
> 
> - Presidential campaigns seem to start immediately after the inauguration. What do you think of the campaign process?
> 
> - I am so frustrated with getting this business off the ground. Do you have any ideas?
> 
> - I am excited about our new mayor. How do you think her administration will be different from her predecessor’s?
> 
> - Working from home sure has its advantages. How has it worked for you?
> 
> - Your lawn always looks so green. What is your secret?
> 
> - We’ve been working together for months now. I’d like to get to know you better. Tell me about some of your outside interests.
> 
> - You worked pretty hard on that stair stepper. What other equipment do you use?
> 
> - You always wear such attractive clothes. What are your favorite stores?
> 
> - What a beautiful home. How do you manage to run a house with four children?
> 
> - I listen to a lot of podcasts, how about you?

## Easy Openers

Like most things that are unfamiliar, starting a conversation appears harder than it actually is. If you still feel uncertain, listen to this true story. A national news show put a hidden microphone on a gentleman and set him loose at a party. His mission was to start as many conversations with women as possible using the ridiculous icebreaker Hi. What’s your sign? Here we are in a new millennium, and he was using that infamous 1970s line! And it worked! He walked up to a woman, smiled, and spoke his line. She responded by saying, Taurus. What’s yours?

He answered with, Libra. Do you know much about astrology ? They went on to have a very interesting conversation. The moral of the story is that it’s the effort that counts. What matters is taking the plunge and starting the conversation. This gentleman was successful because he showed an interest in what the other person had to say, and she was open to it.

## Breaking In Is Hard To Do

You’ve finally gotten up enough nerve to go speak to that one person you’re most determined to meet. But he’s busy chatting away with someone else. How do you break in? While the polite thing to do would be to wait until you get noticed, sometimes the conversation can be so engrossing that you will never be granted an audience unless you take the initiative.

The best approach I’ve found for breaking in is a throwback to bygone dances. In a gentler era, when a man wanted to dance with a woman but she already had a dance partner, all the man had to do was politely tap her dance partner on the shoulder, and the partner would relinquish his turn with the woman.

When you approach a `dancing couple`, wait politely for an interval and then turn to the person you have no desire to speak with and ask for permission to intrude so that you may speak with his or her conversation partner. Most people are too gracious to say no and will give you their permission.

Another option that is less intrusive is to excuse yourself for the interruption, noting that you wanted to let the person know you were in attendance and wanted an opportunity to get together before the evening was over. You will either be included at that point or instead searched out at a later time. **Either way, the person knows you made the effort to touch base**.

## Party of Five

It’s tough for a conversational novice to break into a two-person chat, let alone a group of five or more. Use these tactics when you find  it necessary or desirable to get engaged with these folks:

- **Show interest in the speaker, but stand slightly away from the group**. A group this size is slow to warm, so first let them become accustomed to seeing you. Slowly, they will shift to bring you into the circle.

- **Ease into the group by demonstrating that you’ve been listening**. Look for welcoming signs such as them asking your opinion or physically shifting positions to better include you.

- **Initially, it is best to find a point of agreement; barring that, just acknowledge the speaker**. Wait before rocking the boat with a big wave of radical opinions. Before offering your views, let the group warm to you. If you come on too strong too fast, the group will resent your intrusion and disband. Then you have to start all over again, looking to chat with someone you haven’t just offended!

- **Lastly, if there is a familiar face in the group, quietly extend your hand, letting her know you wish to say hello when she has a moment later in the evening**. Your hope is to be invited into the group. If not, nothing lost but lots gained. She knows you acknowledged her and even if you do not connect later, you have made a positive impression by simply saying hello.
