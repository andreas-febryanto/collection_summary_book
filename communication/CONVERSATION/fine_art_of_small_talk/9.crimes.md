> 
> “How are you?” “Fine.”
> “What’s new?” “Same old, same old.”
> “What has been going on?” “Not much.”
> Instead:
> “How was your weekend?” “Crazy with junior hockey car pools.”
> “How’s work?” “Hectic, I spent a day attending an educational conference.”
> 
> “How’s the project?” “Bold new world for me, lots of new challenges.”
> “What’s new?” “Working on my vegetable garden. I always start with high hopes.”
> “How are you?” “Great, looking forward to a visit from my brother next month.”
> “How have you been?” “I’m finding my footing in this new role at work.”
> “How’s school?” “I am enjoying my speech class more than I expected.”
> “How are things going?” “Planning our annual meeting, which is hybrid this year.”
