# The Feel-Good Factor

People part with their money for two reasons: to solve a problem and to attain good feelings. The feel-good factor underlies every aspect of life.

Here’s how to build rapport that leads to success in every business relationship.

- ###### Use small talk as a picture frame around business conversations.
  
  Begin and end with small talk when making a presentation to a client, selling a widget, negotiating a contract, providing a service, or conferencing with your child’s teacher. A study conducted with physicians showed those who spend a few minutes asking patients about their family, their work, or summer plans before and/or after an examination are less likely to be sued than those who don’t.

- ###### Express empathy.
  
  Everyone is entitled to be listened to, even when in the wrong. 
  
  The stockbroker knows the client insisted on picking the stocks himself, but it would be a mistake to make the client “wrong.” It’s better to say, I realize it’s frustrating to experience this. What can we do from here?

- ###### Greet people warmly, make eye contact, and smile.
  
  Be the first to say hello.

- ###### Use the person’s name in conversation.

- ###### Show an interest in others.

- ###### Dig deeper.
  
  When you engage in a conversation, don’t leave it too quickly. If your customer/client/patient mentions her vacation, pick up on the cue and dig deeper. Ask where she went, what she did, what the highlight was, if she would go back. 

- ###### Be a good listener.
  
  That means making eye contact and responding with verbal cues to show you hear what the speaker says

- ###### Stop being an adviser.
