# Graceful Exit

I find that many people remain in a conversation longer than they should for two reasons: they feel trapped, especially if it’s just a two-person dialogue, or they are so comfortable that they don’t want to leave.

When you prepare to depart a conversation, recall why you originally connected with your conversation partner and bring the conversation back to that topic. Doing so will allow you to make a meaningful connection and then take your leave easily. 

For instance, I was at an open house thrown by a large corporation. Before I left my conversation partner, I said, Tom, it’s been wonderful talking with you about the changes impacting the health-care industry. I need to catch up with another client before she leaves. Thanks for sharing your expertise.

> ###### Exit Lines
> 
> - I need to go see the exhibits.
> 
> - I want to go talk to the speaker.
> 
> - I’m going to circulate and meet some of the new members.
> 
> - I want to see if there are any other people from my industry here today.
> 
> - I must speak with the membership chairperson before she leaves.
> 
> - I promised myself that I’d meet three new people before I leave this evening.
> 
> - I want to meet some other potential clients this morning.
> 
> - I want to get around and say hello to everyone at this meeting/party.

By highlighting your own goals, you take the burden off your conversation partner. Your small-talking associate now knows that your need to move on has nothing to do with the quality of time you just spent with that person.

The cardinal rule of the exit is that when you depart, you do what you said you were going to do.

If you allow yourself to get sidetracked en route to your new destination, you run the risk of insulting your former partner.

## Taking Care of Business

You can invoke your partner’s help in exiting by getting a referral or asking for business.

> ###### Business: Ask for Referrals
> 
> - Can you recommend anyone who needs a ; I’d appreciate the referral.
> 
> - Can you suggest anyone with whom I could speak about ?
> 
> - Who do you know that might be able to help me with ?
> 
> - I had hoped to meet someone who is interested in . Do you know anyone like that?
> 
> - Who else here could I speak to about joining the committee?
> 
> ###### Social: Ask for Referrals
> 
> - I’d like to find someone who’s interested in hiking or who has info on hiking groups. Do you know whether anyone here can help me?
> 
> - Do you know anyone here who’s also new to this area?
> 
> - I’m going to look for someone interested in volunteer activities.
> 
> - Who do you know that might enjoy watching the New York Giants game this Monday night?
> 
> - Anyone you know that also has a second grader?
> 
> - Will you direct me to other new people to the neighborhood?
> 
> - Who do you know here that might know about a nanny share?
> 
> - Are there any other singles here that you can introduce me to?

## The Changing of The Guard

When a new person enters the group and begins talking to one or two people, one or more other people bow out.

A slight variation on the theme is to take your conversation partner with you as you exit. This can be done even when it’s just the two of you talking. You introduce your conversational party to someone who can render assistance to him. This transition is easily made with statements like these:

> ###### Ask Them to Join You
> 
> - I’d like to introduce you to an associate of mine who’s in your field. Let’s see if she’s around.
> 
> - Matt is a great guy with an interesting history. I’d like to introduce you two.
> 
> - Let’s go meet the speaker.
> 
> - I see my friend Jennifer is here. Let’s go say hi.
> 
> - Let’s circulate. I promised myself I’d meet some new people.
> 
> - Let’s go get some dinner.

Issuing an invitation for your partner to join you on your way to another destination is a very gracious and considerate way to exit.

## A Little Appreciation Goes a Long Way

Ending a conversation by showing appreciation for the interchange provides an upbeat way to leave on a positive note. Thanking others for their time, expertise, or the sheer joy of the conversation is always welcome. Some ways to do this are shown here.

> ###### Show Appreciation
> 
> - It was wonderful to see you and hear about the convention.
> 
> - I’ve really enjoyed talking with you about your new business.
> 
> - I am glad you are enjoying your return to the office.
> 
> - I appreciate your willingness to share your expertise.
> 
> - Thank you for the delightful conversation.
> 
> - I’m so glad you introduced me to the subject of . It’s very interesting.
> 
> - It’s nice to meet someone involved in
> 
> - It was so thoughtful of you to introduce me to . Thanks.
> 
> - I appreciate your effort to include me in the conversation. It’s tough being new, and you made it easier for me.
> 
> - Your nephews sound like a handful.
> 
> - The lack of resources for this project is mind boggling.
> 
> - Your coursework for this program does seem overwhelming.
> 
> - Shaking my head at how impossible it can be to manage remote work and kids.
> 
> - Congratulations on creating a shop on Etsy.

Remember to end the conversation the same way you began it—with a smile and a handshake.

## Parting is Such Sweet Sorrow

If you’ve met someone with whom you’d like to further a relationship, the best way to exit is to ask to see him again. Assume the burden of issuing the invitation.

> ###### Issue an Invitation
> 
> - I don’t want to monopolize your time this evening. Can we arrange to meet later?
> 
> - Will I see you at the next meeting?
> 
> - I’ll be thinking of you during your . May I call you when you get back?
> 
> - I’d enjoy spending some time with you. Can I phone you to set up a convenient time?
> 
> - I’ll email that article we discussed to your office next week. I’ll phone you and schedule a time to see if we can find interest in working together. Will that work?
> 
> - I’d like to rehash what we did in class tonight. Would you like to join me for a cup of coffee?
> 
> - I enjoyed working out with you. Do you want to meet next week and do it again?
> 
> - I hope we can do business together soon. May I shoot you an email in the coming days to determine your level of interest?
> 
> - I’m glad to meet you and I would like to learn more about your organization. Will you welcome a phone call
