> He will get over it. (How would you know?)
> You can try again.
> She is in a better place.
> There are no accidents.

> He lived a good, long life.
> I know just how you feel. (You don’t!)
> You need to be strong now.
> This too shall pass.
> Business will bounce back. (How the heck do you know?)
> Instead Try These Empathetic Statements:
> You must feel as though the pain will never end.
> You must really be sad; let me hug you again.
> I would like to come by tomorrow and…
> It isn’t fair, is it?
> I am available to visit with you
> Can I call you tomorrow?
> Take all the time you need.
> Tell me some special memories when you were a child…
> My favorite memory of your loved one is…

I have found it so valuable to always keep him in mind whenever we talk:

> - I’d love to hear stories about Andrew.
> 
> - I’m thinking of you. I know this is another Thanksgiving without Andrew.
> 
> - I’m keeping you and your family in my thoughts. I realize it cannot ever be the same without him.
> 
> - I know the holidays will be hard on you and your family without Andrew here with you.
> 
> - May I come visit with you during this holiday?
> 
> - I remember when Andrew…

One of my favorite pieces of advice on how to talk to someone grieving comes from the memoir Becoming Duchess Goldblatt: “If you’ve ever wondered what the right thing is to say to someone who is grieving a death, I think this is it: Tell me all about your dear one…”



## Talking Politics

> ###### Top Ten TIps for Political Conversation
> 
> 1. Know your audience. If you engage in a political conversation with a business colleague, a friend, or social acquaintance, make sure you have an idea of their position. If you aren’t sure, try asking a more open-ended question that may elicit a defining response: “What are your thoughts on the election?” Tailor your comments to be nonoffensive and not permanently damaging.
> 
> 2. Know your stuff. Be prepared with accurate information about current political happenings so you project credibility.
> 
> 3. Debate facts, not feelings. Keep emotionally driven statements out of your political discussion and stick to hard facts. This way, you don’t hurt anyone’s feelings and your own feelings don’t get harmed. You will be less vulnerable in the end.
> 
> 4. Respect! Respect yourself, your political candidates, your friends, family, and coworkers. Always be thoughtful of what you say and how you say it.
>    • I can tell you’re really frustrated by this issue.
>    • You seem really excited about that event you attended.
>    • I hear you’re hopeful about
> 
> 5. Speak up or shut up. There’s no harm in tastefully expressing your views, but don’t feel pressured to share your thoughts. Just make a personal decision to talk or not talk about it up front and stick with it. Flip-flopping makes you a target for confrontation.
> 
> 6. Listen to what is being said. A powerful political conversation has two sides. Take time to hear what your conversation partner says and appreciate their opinion. Ask questions you think will enhance the dialogue.
> 
> 7. Know when to back down, turn around, and walk away. Think before you speak. If you feel like the conversation is getting too intense or uncomfortable, excuse yourself. Read body language to help keep your comments in check.
> 
> 8. Agree to disagree. It’s fun to have stimulating political banter, but if you agree to disagree up front it can be more entertaining and less destructive.
> 
> 9. Remember you’re on the same side. At the end of the day, you will probably continue to attend the same back-to-school nights, participate in the same social circle, and definitely remain in the same family, so don’t let political conversations interfere with your relationships.
> 
> 10. If in the workplace, know the company’s policies. Know what is and isn’t allowed in the way of political expression (e.g., sending out political emails, hanging signs) and adhere to management requests.
