# Make the Most of Networking Events

## Turn Every Conversation Into Succesfull Business Networking

step:

1. ###### Introduce and initiate
   
   Be aware of how he introduces himself (you may know him as Charles, but maybe he goes by Chuck), and use his preferred name throughout your interaction.

2. ###### Use an icebreaker. Don't act like an FBI agent
   
   Using an icebreaker such as “Tell me about your organization” is unique, yet does not pin someone down into labeling themselves. Some other valuable icebreakers you might use are:
   
   - “Bring me up to date on your latest project.”
   
   - “What do you find to be the most enjoyable aspect of your job?”
   
   - “Tell me about your history with .”
   
   - “How did you come to find yourself in the health care field?”

3. ###### Express interest and make an effort
   
   Remember, people want to be with people who make them feel special,not people who are “special.” Take responsibility to help people you talk to feel as if they’re the only person in the room.

4. ###### Find common ground
   
   As long as you stay on a subject you are both familiar with—like your specific field or the day’s event—you’ll be able to communicate easily.

5. ###### Overcome awkard pauses
   
   Be prepared.Spend a few minutes before an anticipated event preparing to talk easily about two to three topics.

6. ###### Stop conversation monopolists in their tracks
   
   If possible, wait for the person to take a breath or to pause, then break in with a comment about their topic.

7. ###### Join the conversation ready to play the conversation game
   
   Tell more about yourself so that others can learn more about you. When waiting for a meeting to begin, your client asks how your summer is going.

8. ###### Establish personal boundaries

9. ###### Be aware of body language

10. ###### Exit thoughtfully
