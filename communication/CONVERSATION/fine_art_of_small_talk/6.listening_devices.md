# Hearing Aids and Listening Devices

The dilemma is that we have the capacity to take in much more information than one person can divulge at any given time. So what do we do with this excess capacity? We put it to good use, of course. We eavesdrop on other conversations; we start thinking about what to have for dinner; we drift away into our private thoughts—and suddenly we’ve drifted too far… and missed something important!

Psychologist Carl Rogers once said, **The biggest block to personal conversation is one man’s inability to listen intelligently, understandingly, and skillfully to another person“**.

Attentive listening has three parts: visual, verbal, and mental.

## Listening is Seen, Not Just Heard

We cannot watch the sound vibrations go into someone’s ears to confirm that they received the intended message. Consequently, the speaker is always on the lookout for cues to validate receipt of the message. Visual cues, which offer the easiest form of feedback, let the speaker know you are paying attention. Facial expressions, head nods, and positive body language are clear ways of expressing interest in your conversation partner’s words.

###### Positive Messages to the Speaker

- Lean forward

- Maintain eye contact

- Open up your arms and body

- Relax your body posture

###### Off-Putting Gestures You Should Never Use

- Pointing

- Covering your mouth

- Rubbing or fondling body parts

- Fiddling with jewelry

- Tapping a pencil or pen

- Swinging your leg

- Crossing arms across your chest

- Putting hands on your hips

- Glancing away from the person who is speaking

- Holding your device in your hand or placing it on the dining table. This suggests you are open to distraction.

## Verbalize Your Listening

You can use verbal cues to show that you have a positive response, that you disagree, or that you want to hear more about something in particular.

| If you want to show that you are: | Say:                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interested in hearing more        | Tell me more. What was that like for you?                                   |
| Taking it all in                  | Hmm, I see                                                                  |
| Responding positively             | How interesting! What an accomplishment!                                    |
| Diverging                         | On the other hand, what do you think ?                                      |
| Expanding on the idea             | Along that same line, do you ... ? why ?                                    |
| Arguing/refuting                  | What proof do you have of that ?                                            |
| Involving yourself                | Could I do that? What would it mean to me ?                                 |
| Clarifying                        | I'm not sure I'm clear on your feelings about                               |
| Empathizing                       | That must have been tough/frustrating, et cetera                            |
| Probing                           | What do you mean by that? How were you able to manage?                      |
| Seeking Specifics                 | Can you give me an example ?                                                |
| Seeking generalities              | What's the big picture here ?                                               |
| Looking to the future             | What do you think will happen next ?                                        |
| Reviewing the past                | What happened first?                                                        |
| Seeking likenesses/differences    | Have you ever seen anything like this ? What's the opposing point of view ? |
| Seeking extremes/contrast         | What's the downside ? What's the optimum ?                                  |

## Stating the Obvious

When you paraphrase what’s been said, or repeat the specifics of what you have heard, there can be no doubt that you have listened and understood the speaker.

Paraphrasing the speaker clarifies that you understood accurately. Or it can help the speaker recognize that you misunderstood what she was attempting to communicate.

In an emotionally charged situation, you gain a side benefit of defusing anger when you repeat the specifics of what the other person stated.

Skilled customer service managers know that by repeating what an angry customer is saying, they can reduce the level of hostility.

Before expressing apologies, before solving a problem, let the person know that they have been heard by repeating the specifics:

- So I can expect the budget changes by Thursday?

- We agree you plan on issuing the invitation via snail mail?

- You and I will revisit this during our next meeting, that works for you?

- Just so I am sure I understand you, your food was not delivered on time and it was cold?

- I understand you wish to make our relationship exclusive sooner rather than later, or are you saying something else?

- If I sponsor this organization, I will receive the following… correct?

## Mental Listening Skills

All the visual and verbal cues in the world are useless if you haven’t stayed focused enough on the conversation to track it well. If you are too bored to stay with the conversation, exit gracefully instead of embarrassing your conversation partner by demonstrating boredom.
