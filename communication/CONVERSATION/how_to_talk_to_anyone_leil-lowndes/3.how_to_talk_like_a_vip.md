# Part 3: How to Know What to Say After You Say "Hi"

Welcome to the human jungle. When two tigers prowling through the jungle chance upon one another in a clearing, they look at each other. They freeze. Instinctively they calculate, “If our staring came to hissing—came to scratching—came to clawing—who would win? Which of us has the stronger survival skills?”

Tigers in the wilderness differ little from the urban upright animals inhabiting the corporate jungle (or singles jungle or social jungle). Humans start the process by looking at each other and talking. In the business world, while smiling and uttering “How do you do?” “Hello,” “Howdy,” or “Hi,” they are, like tigers, instinctively, instantaneously, sizing each other up.

They’re not calculating the length of each other’s claws or the sharpness of their teeth. They’re judging each other on a weapon far more powerful to survival as they have defined it. Humans are judging each other’s communications skills.

## How to Find Out What They Do (Without Even Asking!)

To size each other up, the first question little cats flat-pawedly ask each other is, “And what do you do? Hmm?” Then they crouch there, quivering their whiskers and twitching their noses, with an obvious “I’m going to pronounce silent judgment on you after you answer” look on their pusses.

Big cats never ask outright, “What do you do?” (Oh they find out, all right, in a much more subtle manner.) By not asking the question, the big boys and big girls come across as more principled, even spiritual. “After all,” their silence says, “a man or woman is far more than his or her job.”

> Technique 24.**What Do You Do—NOT!**
> 
> A sure sign you’re a Somebody is the conspicuous absence of the question, “What do you do?” (You determine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words that label you as either a ruthless networker, a social climber, a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or someone who’s never strolled along Easy Street.)

#### The Right Way to Find Out

All together now: “How . . . do . . . you . . . spend . . . most . . . of . . . your . . . time?”

Now, suppose you’ve just made the acquaintance of someone who does like to talk about his or her work? Asking, “How do you spend most of your time?” also opens the door for workaholics to spout off, “Oh golly,” they mock moan, “I just spend all my time working.” That, of course, is your invitation to grill them for details. (Then they’ll talk your ear off.) Yet the new wording of your question gives those who are somewhere between “at leisure” and “work addicted” the choice of telling you about their job or not. Finally, asking “How do you spend most of your time?” instead of “And what do you do?” gives you your big cat stripes right off.

## How to Know What to Say When They Ask, "What Do You Do"

Many folks have one written résumé for job seeking. They type it up and then trudge off to the printer to get a nice neat stack to send to all prospective employers. The résumé lists their previous positions, dates of employment, and education. Then, at the bottom, they might as well have scribbled, “Well, that’s me. Take it or leave it.” And usually they get left. Why? Because prospective employers do not find enough specific points in the résumé that relate directly to what their firm is seeking.

Boys and girls in the big leagues, however, have bits and bytes of their entire work experience tucked away in their computers. When applying for a job, they punch up only the appropriate data and print it out so it looks like it just came from the printer.

To make the most of every encounter, personalize your verbal résumé with just as much care as you would your written curriculum vitae. Instead of having one answer to the omnipresent “What do you do?” prepare a dozen or so variations, depending on who’s asking. For optimum networking, every time someone asks about your job, give a calculated oral résumé in a nutshell. Before you submit your answer, consider what possible interest the asker could have in you and your work.

#### Here's How My Life Can Benefit Yours

Top salespeople talk extensively of the “benefit statement.” They know, when talking with a potential client, they should open their conversation with a benefit statement.

Putting the benefit statement in your verbal “Nutshell Résumé” brings your job to life and makes it memorable. Even if your new acquaintance can’t use your services, the next time he or she meets someone moving into the area, wanting to plan their financial future, thinking of self defense, considering cosmetic surgery, or needing a new hairstyle, who comes to mind? Not the unimaginative people who gave the tax-return description of their jobs, but the big winners who painted a picture of helping people with needs.

## A Nutshell Resume for Your Private Life

When meeting a potential friend or loved one, make your life sound like you will be a fun person to know.

> Technique 25.**The Nutshell Résumé**
> 
> Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written résumé off their printers for each position they’re applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to “What do you do?” ask yourself, “What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?” 
> 
> Wherever you go, pack a nutshell about your own life to work into your communications bag of tricks.

## How to Sound Even Smarter Than You

The world perceives people with rich vocabularies to be more creative, more intelligent. People with larger vocabularies get hired quicker, promoted faster, and listened to a whole lot more. So big winners use rich, full words, but they never sound inappropriate. The phrases slide gracefully off their tongues to enrich their conversation. The words fit. With the care that they choose their tie or their blouse, big players in life choose words to match their personalities and their points.

All you need to do is think of a few tired, overworked words you use every day—words like smart, nice, pretty, or good. Then grab a thesaurus or book of synonyms off the shelf. Look up that common word even you are bored hearing yourself utter every day. Examine your long list of alternatives.

For example, if you turn to the word smart, you’ll find dozens of synonyms. Some words are colorful and rich like ingenious, resourceful, adroit, shrewd, and many more.

> Technique 26.**Your Personal Thesaurus**
> 
> Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements.
> 
> Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the verbally elite.

## How to Not Sound Anxious (Let Them Discover Your Similarity)

When you delay revealing your similarity, or let them discover it, it has much more punch. Above all, you don’t want to sound anxious to have rapport.

Whenever someone mentions a common interest or experience, instead of jumping in with a breathless, “Hey, me, too! I do that, too” or “I know all about that,” let your conversation partner enjoy talking about it. Let her go on about the country club before you tell her you’re a member, too. Let him go on analyzing the golf swing of Arnold Palmer before you start casually comparing the swings of golf greats Greg, Jack, Tiger, and Arnie.

Here’s the technique I call “Kill the Quick ‘Me, Too!’” Whenever people mention an activity or interest you share, let them enjoy discussing their passion. Then, when the time is right, casually mention you share their interest.

> Technique 27.**Kill the Quick “Me, Too!”**
> Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger.
> 
> P.S.: Don’t wait too long to reveal your shared interest or it will seem like you’re being tricky.

## How to Be a "You-Firstie" to Gain Their Respect and Affection

“SEX! Now that I have your attention. . . . ” Two-bit comics have been using that gag from the days when two bits bought a foursquare meal. However, big winners know there’s a three-letter word more potent then SEX to get people’s attention. That word is YOU.

Why is you such a powerful word? Because when we were infants, we thought we were the center of the universe. Nothing mattered but ME, MYSELF, and I. The rest of the shadowy forms stirring about us (which we later learned were other people) existed solely for what they could do for us. Self-centered little tykes that we were, our tiny brains translated every action, every word, into, “How does that affect ME?”

Big winners know we haven’t changed a bit. Adults camouflage their self-centeredness under a mask of civilization and politeness. Yet the human brain still immediately, instinctively, and unfailingly translates everything into terms of “How does that affect ME?”

For example, suppose, gentlemen, you want to ask a colleague, Jill, if she would like to join you for dinner. So you say to her, “There’s a really good new Indian restaurant in town. Will you join me there for dinner tonight?”

Before answering, Jill is thinking to herself, “By ‘good’ does he mean the food or the atmosphere or both?” Her reverie continues, “Indian cuisine, I’m not sure. He says it’s good. However, will I like it?” While thinking, Jill hesitates. You probably take her hesitation personally, and the joy of the exchange diminishes.

Suppose, instead, you had said to her, “Jill, you will really love this new Indian restaurant. Will you join me there this evening for dinner?” Phrasing it that way, you’ve already subliminally answered Jill’s questions and she’s more apt to give you a quick “yes.”

The pleasure-pain principle is a guiding force in life. Psychologists tell us everyone automatically gravitates toward that which is pleasurable and pulls away from that which is painful. For many people, thinking is painful.

#### Comm-YOU-nicate When You want a Favor

In the first case, Boss had to translate your “Can I take Friday off?” into “Can I do without this employee Friday?” That’s an extra thought process. (And you know how some bosses hate to think!)

However, in the second case, “Boss, can you do without me Friday,” you did Boss’s thinking for her. Your new wording made managing without you a matter of pride for Boss. “Of course,” she said to herself. “I can manage without your help Friday.”

#### Comm-YOU-nicate Your Compliments

Comm-YOU-nication also enriches your social conversation. Gentlemen, say a lady likes your suit. Which woman gives you warmer feelings? The woman who says, “I like your suit.” Or the one who says, “You look great in that suit.”

> Technique 28.**Comm-YOU-nication**
> Start every appropriate sentence with you. It immediately grabs your listener’s attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into “me” terms.
> 
> When you sprinkle you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice.

Eve did not ask Adam to eat the apple. She did not command him to eat the apple. She didn’t even say, “Adam, I want you to eat this apple.” She phrased it (as all big winners would), “You will love this apple.” That’s why he bit.

## How to Make Them Feel You "Don't Smile at Just Anybody"

Whereas models in more sophisticated magazines have mastered a myriad of different expressions: a flirtatious “I’ve got a secret” smile on one page; a quizzical “I think I’d like to get to know you but I’m not sure” smile on the next; and a mysterious Mona Lisa smile on the third. You feel there’s a brain running the operation somewhere inside that beautiful head.

#### Review Your Repertoire of Smiles

If your job required you to carry a gun, you would, of course, learn all about the moving parts before firing it. And before taking aim, you would carefully consider whether it would murder, maim, or merely wound your target. Since your smile is one of your biggest communications weapons, learn all about the moving parts and the effect on your target. Set aside five minutes. Lock your bedroom or bathroom door so your family doesn’t think you’ve gone off the deep end. Now stand in front of the mirror and flash a few smiles. Discover the subtle differences in your repertoire.

> Technique 29.**The Exclusive Smile**
> If you flash everybody the same smile, like a Confederate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty big players find in each new face.
> 
> If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her.

## How to Avoid Sounding Like a Jerk

One of the quickest ways to make a big winner think you are, well, a jerk, is to use a cliché. If you’re chatting with a top communicator and even innocently remark “Yes, I was tired as a dog,” or “She was cute as a button,” you’ve unknowingly laid a linguistic bomb.

> Technique 30.**Don’t Touch a Cliché with a Ten-Foot Pole**
> Be on guard. Don’t use any clichés when chatting with big winners. Don’t even touch one with a ten-foot pole. Never? Not even when hell freezes over? Not unless you want to sound dumb as a doorknob.
> 
> Instead of coughing up a cliché, roll your own clever phrases by using the next technique.

## How to Use Motivational Speakers' Techniques to Enhance Your Conversation

The professional speaker starts out with the same equipment we all have. The difference is, these jawsmiths use it all. They use their hands, they use their bodies, and they use specific gestures with heavy impact. They think about the space they’re talking in. They employ many different tones of voice, they invoke various expressions, they vary the speed with which they speak . . . and they make effective use of silence.

#### A Gem for Every Ocassion

One of my favorite speakers is a radio broadcaster named Barry Farber who brightens up late-night radio with sparkling similes. Barry would never use a cliché like “nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof.” He’d describe being nervous about losing his job as “I felt like an elephant dangling over a cliff with his tail tied to a daisy.” Instead of saying he looked at a pretty woman, he’d say, “My eyeballs popped out and dangled by the optic nerve.”

**Look through books of similes to enrich your day-to-day conversations.**

Find phrases that have visual impact. Instead of a cliché like “sure as death and taxes,” try “as certain as beach traffic in July” or “as sure as your shadow will follow you.” Your listeners can’t see death or taxes. But they sure can see beach traffic in July or their shadow following them down the street. Try to make your similes relate to the situation.

#### Make 'Em Laugh, Make 'Em Laugh, Make 'Em Laugh

Humor enriches any conversation. But not jokes starting with, “Hey didja hear the one about . . . ?” Plan your humor and make it relevant.

Once, during an oppressive financial meeting, I heard a top executive say, “Don’t worry, this company has enough money to stay in business for years—unless we pay our creditors.” He broke the tension and won the appreciation of all.

#### A Word of Warning

No matter how good your material is, it bombs if it doesn’t fit the situation.

> Technique 31.**Use Jawsmith’s Jive**
> 
> Whether you’re standing behind a podium facing thousands or behind the barbecue grill facing your family, you’ll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills.
> 
> Read speakers’ books to cull quotations, pull pearls  of wisdom, and get gems to tickle their funny bones. Find a few bon mots to let casually slide off your tongue on chosen occasions. If you want to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable.
> 
> Make ’em rhyme, make ’em clever, or make ’em funny. Above all, make ’em relevant.

## How to Banter Like the Big Shots Do (Big Winners Tell It Like It Is)

> Technique 32.**Call a Spade a Spade**
> Don’t hide behind euphemisms. Call a spade a spade. That doesn’t mean big cats use tasteless four-letter words when perfectly decent five- and six-letter ones exist. They’ve simply learned the King’s English, and they speak it.
> 
> Here’s another way to tell the big players from the little ones just by listening to a few minutes of their conversation.

## How to Avoid the World's Worst Conversational Habit

> Technique 33.**Trash the Teasing**
> A dead giveaway of a little cat is his or her proclivity to tease. An innocent joke at someone else’s expense may get you a cheap laugh. Nevertheless, the big cats will have the last one. Because you’ll bang your head against the glass ceiling they construct to keep little cats from stepping on their paws.
> 
> Never, ever, make a joke at anyone else’s expense. You’ll wind up paying for it, dearly.

## How to Give Them the Bad News (and Have Them Like You All the More)

In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the humblest message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news. However, if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was chopped off.

It’s not the news that makes someone angry. It’s the unsympathetic attitude with which it’s delivered. Everyone must give bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient she needs an operation does it with compassion.

> Technique 34.**It’s the Receiver’s Ball**
> 
> A football player wouldn’t last two beats of the time clock if he made blind passes. A pro throws the ball with the receiver always in mind.
> 
> Before throwing out any news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but how the receiver will take it.

Had my neighbor told me of the impending rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning. Had the Greyhound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left, I probably would have said, “Oh, that’s all right I’ll catch the next one.”

## How to Respond When You Don't Want to Answer(and Wish They'd Shut the Heck Up)

> Technique 35.**The Broken Record**
> 
> Whenever someone persists in questioning you on an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice. Hearing it again usually quiets them down. If your rude interrogator hangs on like a leech, your next repetition never fails to flick them off.

## How to Talk to a Celebrity

> Technique 36.**Big Shots Don’t Slobber**
> 
> People who are VIPs in their own right don’t slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one, don’t compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or insight it’s given you. If you do single out any one of the star’s accomplishments, make sure it’s a recent one, not a memory that’s getting yellow in her scrapbook.
> 
> If the queen bee has a drone sitting with her, find a way to involve him in the conversation.

## How to Make Them Want to Thank You

Very simply, never let the phrase thank you stand naked and alone. Always make it thank you for something. People use the bare exposed “thank you” so often that people don’t even hear it anymore.

Whenever the occasion warrants more than an unconscious acknowledgment, dress up your “thank you” with the reason:

Thank you for coming.

Thank you for being so understanding.

Thank you for waiting.

Thank you for being such a good customer.

Thank you for being so loving.

> Technique 37.**Never the Naked Thank You**
> Never let the phrase “thank you” stand alone. From A to Z, always follow it with for: from “Thank you for asking” to “Thank you for zipping me up.”
