## Chapter 15 Ten Exercises for Keeping Your Eyes Speed-Reading Ready

- ###### Eye Squeezes
  
  Doing eye squeezes relaxes your eyes, makes your eye muscles more flexible, and increases the flow of blood and oxygen to your eyes and face.

- ###### Thumb-to-Thumb Glancing
  
  Thumb-to-thumb glancing works the muscles in your eye sockets that control peripheral vision and stretches the eye muscles in general to make them healthier and more flexible.

- ###### Tree Pose
  
  The tree pose is a yoga balancing exercise that’s essentially a more advanced version of thumb-to-thumb glancing (covered in the preceding section).

- ###### Eye Rolling
  
  Eye rolling strengthens the extra-ocular muscles of the eye socket that control the position of the eyeball and makes your eyes more flexible.

- ###### Eye Writing
  
  Eye writing exercises the extra-ocular muscles of the eye socket and is especially good for increasing the eyeball’s flexibility and range of motion.

- ###### The 10-10-10
  
  This exercise is called the 10-10-10 because it asks you to stare at an object that is ten or more feet away for ten seconds every ten minutes when you’re reading intently.

- ###### Change of Focus
  
  This exercise increases the strength and flexibility of the ciliary muscles used in focusing.

- ###### Palming
  
  When duty calls and you must keep reading in spite of tired eyes, take a 3- to 5-minute break and practice this technique.

- ###### Hooded Eyes

- ###### Eye Massage
  
  Massaging the eyes is as good for the eyeballs as a shoulder or neck massage is for those areas.

- ###### Renew Your Commitment

- ###### Expand Your Reading Vision

- ###### Shush Your Inner Reading Voice

- ###### Read More Often

- ###### Be a Goal-Oriented Reader

- ###### Occasionally Time Yourself

- ###### Do Your Exercises

- ###### Visit the Optometrist

## Appendix A

#### Discovering Prime Words

I call these words prime words because they’re the primary words you encounter in your reading. Based on our experiment with Project Guttenberg, these prime words represent 75 percent of all the words in the English language. That means that you can master the prime words and rest assured that you know 75 percent of the vocabulary words you need in your reading.

###### Prime Words List

Following are lists of the 2,000 prime words divided into 10 groups of about 200 words per group. Group 1 lists the most common prime words; group 10 lists the least common.
