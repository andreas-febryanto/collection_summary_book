# Chapter 2. Saying No

> Do; or do not. There is no trying.

Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But 
professionals are expected to say no. Indeed, good managers crave someone who has the guts to say no. It’s the only way you can really get anything done.

## Adversarial Roles

> He had built teams where there were no adversarial relationships; the teams worked together in harmony and without confrontation.

> I’m happy for this reviewer, but I wonder if his teams are really as confrontation.
> 
> free as he supposes. And if they are, I wonder if they are as efficient as they could be. My own experience has been that the hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of adversarial roles
> 
> Best possible case, each party pursue for the best possible outcome:

> ```
> Mike: “Paula, I need the login page done by tomorrow.”
> Paula: “No, Mike, that’s a two-week job.”
> Mike: “Two weeks? The architects estimated it at three days and it’s 
> already been five!”
> Paula: “The architects were wrong, Mike. They did their estimates before 
> product marketing got hold of the requirements. I’ve got at least 
> ten more days of work to do on this. Didn’t you see my updated 
> estimate on the wiki?”
> Mike: (looking stern and trembling with frustration) “This isn’t acceptable 
> Paula. Customers are coming for a demo tomorrow, and I’ve got to 
> show them the login page working.”
> Paula: “What part of the login page do you need working by 
> tomorrow?”
> Mike: “I need the login page! I need to be able to log in.”
> Paula: “Mike, I can give you a mock-up of the login page that will let you 
> log in. I’ve got that working now. It won’t actually check your 
> username and password, and it won’t email a forgotten password to 
> you. It won’t have the company news banner “Times-squaring” 
> around the top of it, and the help button and hover text won’t 
> work. It won’t store a cookie to remember you for next time, and it 
> won’t put any permission restrictions on you. But you’ll be able to

> Mike: “I’ll be able to log in?”
> Paula: “Yes, you’ll be able to log in.”
> Mike: “That’s great Paula, you’re a life saver!” (walks away pumping the 
> air and saying “Yes!”)
> ```
> 
> They did this by saying no and then 
> working out a solution that was mutually agreeable to both. They were acting

> pursue goals that aren’t in perfect alignment.
> 
> ### What About the Why ?
> 
> Perhaps you think that Paula should have explained why the login page was going to take so much longer. My experience is that the why is a lot less important than the fact. That fact is that the login page will require two weeks. Why it will take two weeks is just a detail.
> 
> Still, knowing why might help Mike to understand, and therefore to accept, the fact. Fair enough. And in situations where Mike has the technical expertise and temperament to understand, such explanations might be useful. On the other hand, Mike might disagree with the conclusion. Mike might decide that Paula was doing it all wrong. He might tell her that she doesn’t need all that testing, or all that reviewing, or that step 12 could be omitted. Providing too much detail can be an invitation for micro-management.

## High Stakes

> The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest. The higher the stakes, the more valuable no becomes.
> 
> This should be self-evident. When the cost of failure is so high that the survival of your company depends upon it, you must be absolutely determined to give your managers the best information you can. And that often means saying no.
> 
> ```
> Don (Director of Development): “So, our current estimate for completion of the Golden Goose project is twelve weeks from today, with an uncertainty of plus or minus five weeks.”
> Charles (CEO): (sits glaring for fifteen seconds as his face reddens) “Do  you mean to sit there and tell me that we might be seventeen weeks  from delivery?”
> Don: “That’s possible, yes.”
> Charles: (stands up, Don stands up a second later) “Damm it Don! This was supposed to be done three weeks ago! I’ve got Galitron calling me every day wondering where their frakking system is. I am not going to tell them that they have to wait another four months? You’ve got to do better.”
> Don: Chuck, I told you three months ago, after all the layoffs, that we’d need four more months. I mean, Christ Chuck, you cut my staff twenty percent! Did you tell Galitron then that we’d be late?”
> Charles: “You know damned well I didn’t. We can’t afford to lose that order Don. (Charles pauses, his face goes white) Without Galitron, we’re really hosed. You know that, don’t you? And now with this delay, I’m afraid . . . What will I tell the board? (He slowly sits back down in his seat, trying not to crumble.) Don, you’ve got to do better.”
> Don: “There’s nothing I can do Chuck. We’ve been through this already. Galitron won’t cut scope, and they won’t accept any interim releases. They want to do the installation once and be done with it. I simply cannot do that any faster. It’s not going to happen.”
> Charles: “Damn. I don’t suppose it would matter if I told you your job was at stake.”
> Don: “Firing me isn’t going to change the estimate, Charles.”
> Charles: “We’re done here. Go back to your team and keep this project moving. I’ve got some very tough phone calls to make.”
> ```
> 
> Of course, Charles should have told Galitron no three months ago when he first found out about the new estimate. At least now he’s doing the right thing by calling them (and the board). But if Don hadn’t stuck to his guns, those calls might have been delayed even longer.

## Being A "Team Player"

> Being a team player means playing your position as well as you possibly can, and helping out your teammates when they get into a jam. A team-player communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her teammates, and executes his or her own responsibilities as well as possible.

A team player is not someone who says yes all the time. Consider this scenario:

> ```
> Paula: “Mike, I’ve got those estimates for you. The team agrees that we’ll be ready to give a demo in about eight weeks, give or take one week.”
> Mike: “Paula, we’ve already scheduled the demo for six weeks from now.”
> Paula: “Without hearing from us first? Come on Mike, you can’t push that on us.”
> Mike: “It’s already done.”
> Paula: (sigh) “OK, look, I’ll go back to the team and find out what we can safely deliver in six weeks, but it won’t be the whole system. There’ll be some features missing, and the data load will be incomplete.”
> Mike: “Paula, the customer is expecting to see a complete demo.”
> Paula: “That’s not going to happen Mike.”
> Mike: “Damn. OK, work up the best plan you can and let me know tomorrow.”
> Paula: “That I can do.”
> Mike: “Isn’t there something you can do to bring this date in? Maybe there’s a way to work smarter and get creative.”
> Paula: “We’re all pretty creative, Mike. We’ve got a good handle on the problem, and the date is going to be eight or nine weeks, not six.”
> Mike: “You could work overtime.”
> Paula: “That just makes us go slower, Mike. Remember the mess we made last time we mandated overtime?”
> Mike: “Yeah, but that doesn’t have to happen this time.”
> Paula: “It’ll be just like last time, Mike. Trust me. It’s going to be eight or nine weeks, not six.”
> Mike: “OK, get me your best plan, but keep thinking about how to get it done in six weeks. I know you guys’ll figure out something.”
> Paula: “No, Mike, we won’t. I’ll get you a plan for six weeks, but it will be missing a lot of features and data. That’s just how it’s going to be.”
> Mike: “OK, Paula, but I bet you guys can work miracles if you try.”
> (Paula walks away shaking her head.)
> ```
> 
> Later, in the Director’s strategy meeting …
> 
> ```
> Don: “OK Mike, as you know the customer is coming in for a demo in six weeks. They’re expecting to see everything working.”
> Mike: “Yes, and we’ll be ready. My team is busting their butts on this and we’re going to get it done. We’ll have to work some overtime, and get pretty creative, but we’ll make it happen!”
> Don: “It’s great that you and your staff are such team players.”
> ```
> 
> Who were the real team players in this scenario? Paula was playing for the team, because she represented what could, and could not, be done to the best of her ability. She aggressively defended her position, despite the wheedling and cajoling from Mike. Mike was playing on a team of one. Mike is for Mike. He’s clearly not on Paula’s team because he just committed her to something she explicitly said she couldn’t do. He’s not on Don’s team either (though he’d disagree) because he just lied through his teeth.
> 
> So why did Mike do this? He wanted Don to see him as a team player, and he has faith in his ability to wheedle and manipulate Paula into trying for the six week deadline. Mike is not evil; he’s just too confident in his ability to get people to do what he wants.

### Trying

> The worst thing Paula could do in response to Mike’s manipulations is say “OK, we’ll try.” I hate to channel Yoda here, but in this instance he is correct. There is no trying.

The word try has many definitions. The definition I take issue with here is “to apply extra effort.” What extra effort could Paula apply to get the demo ready in time? If there is extra effort she could apply, then she and her team must not have been applying all their effort before. They must have been holding some effort in reserve.

> The promise to try is an admission that you’ve been holding back, that you have a reservoir of extra effort that you can apply. The promise to try is an admission that the goal is attainable through the application of this extra effort; moreover, it is a commitment to apply that extra effort to achieve the goal. Therefore, by promising to try you are committing to succeed. This puts the burden on you. If your “trying” does not lead to the desired outcome, you will have failed.
> 
> If you are not holding back some energy in reserve, if you don’t have a new plan, if you aren’t going to change your behavior, and if you are reasonably confident in your original estimate, then promising to try is fundamentally dishonest. You are lying. And you are probably doing it to save face and to avoid a confrontation.
> 
> Paula’s approach was much better. She continued to remind Mike that the team’s estimate was uncertain. She always said “eight or nine weeks.” She stressed the uncertainty and never backed off. She never suggested that there might be some extra effort, or some new plan, or some change in behavior that could reduce that uncertainty.
> 
> ```
> Three weeks later ...
> Mike: “Paula, the demo is in three weeks, and the customers are demanding to see File Upload working.”
> Paula: “Mike, that’s not on the list of features we agreed to.”
> Mike: “I know, but they’re demanding it.”
> Paula: “OK, that means that either Single Sign-on or Backup will have to be dropped from the demo.”
> Mike: “Absolutely not! They’re expecting to see those features working as well!”
> Paula: “So then, they are expecting to see every feature working. Is that what you are telling me? I told you that wasn’t going to happen.”
> Mike: “I’m sorry Paula, but the customer just won’t budge on this. They want to see it all.”
> Paula: “That’s not going to happen, Mike. It’s just not.”
> Mike: “Come on Paula, can’t you guys at least try?”
> Paula: “Mike, I could try to levitate. I could try to change lead in to gold. I could try to swim across the Atlantic. Do you think I’d succeed?”
> Mike: “Now you’re being unreasonable. I’m not asking for the impossible.”
> Paula: “Yes, Mike, you are.”
> (Mike smirks, nods, and turns to walk away.)
> Mike: “I’ve got faith in you Paula; I know you won’t let me down.”
> Paula: (speaking to Mike’s back) “Mike, you’re dreaming. This is not going to end well.”
> (Mike just waves without turning around.)
> ```

### Passive Aggression

Paula’s got an interesting decision to make. She suspects that Mike is not telling Don about her estimates. She could just let Mike walk off the end of the cliff. She could make sure that copies of all the appropriate memos were on file, so that when the disaster strikes she can show what she told Mike, and when she told him. This is passive aggression. She’d just let Mike hang himself.

Or, she could try to head off the disaster by communicating directly with Don. This is risky, to be sure, but it’s also what being a team player is really all about. When a freight train is bearing down on you and you are the only one who can see it, you can either step quietly off the track and watch everyone else get run over, or you can yell “Train! Get off the track!”

> ```
> Two days later ...
> Paula: “Mike, have you told Don about my estimates? Has he told the customer that the demo will not have the File Upload feature working?”
> Mike: “Paula, you said you’d get that working for me.”
> Paula: “No, Mike, I didn’t. I told you that it was impossible. Here’s a copy of the memo I sent you after our talk.”
> Mike: “Yeah, but you were going to try anyway, right?”
> Paula: “We’ve already had that discussion Mike. Remember, gold and lead?”
> Mike: (sighs) “Look, Paula, you’ve just got to do it. You just have to. Please do whatever it takes, but you just have to make this happen for me.”
> Paula: “Mike. You’re wrong. I don’t have to make this happen for you. What I have to do, if you don’t, is tell Don.”
> Mike: “That’d be going over my head, you wouldn’t do that.”
> Paula: “I don’t want to Mike, but I will if you force me.”
> Mike: “Oh, Paula . . .”
> Paula: “Look, Mike, the features aren’t going to get done in time for the demo. You need to get this into your head. Stop trying to convince me to work harder. Stop deluding yourself that I’m somehow going to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Face the fact that you have to tell Don, and you have to tell him today.”
> Mike: (Eyes wide) “Today?”
> Paula: “Yes, Mike. Today. Because tomorrow I expect to have a meeting with you and Don about which features to include in the demo. If that meeting doesn’t happen tomorrow, then I will be forced to go to Don myself. Here’s a copy of the memo that explains just that.”
> Mike: “You’re just covering your ass!”
> Paula: “Mike, I’m trying to cover both our asses. Can you imagine the debacle if the customer comes here expecting a full demo and we can’t deliver?”
> ```
> 
> What happens in the end to Paula and Mike? I’ll leave it to you to work out the possibilities. The point is that Paula has behaved very professionally. She has said no at all the right times, and in all the right ways. She said no when pushed to amend her estimates. She said no when manipulated, cajoled, and begged. And, most importantly, she said no to Mike’s self-delusion and inaction. Paula was playing for the team. Mike needed help, and she used every means in her power to help him.

## The Cose of Saying Yes

Most of the time we want to say yes. Indeed, healthy teams strive to find a way to say yes. Manager and developers in well-run teams will negotiate with each other until they come to a mutually agreed upon plan of action.

> But, as we’ve seen, sometimes the only way to get to the right yes is to be unafraid so say no.

## Code Impossible

In the story when John asks “Is good code impossible?”, he is really asking “Is professionalism impossible?” After all, it wasn’t just the code that suffered in his tale of dysfunction. It was his family, his employer, his customer, and the users. Everybody lost in this adventure. And they lost due to unprofessionalism. So who was acting unprofessionally?

Perhaps it was John’s direct employer. John didn’t say this explicitly, but there was a hint when he said, parenthetically, “In business, client importance matters.” So did John’s employer make unreasonable promises to Gorilla Mart? Did they put pressure on John, directly or indirectly, to make those promises come true? John doesn’t say this, so we can only wonder.

Even so, where is John’s responsibility in all of this? I put the fault squarely on John. John is the one who accepted the initial two-week deadline, knowing full well that projects are usually more complex than they sound. John is the one who accepted the need to write the PHP server. John is the one who accepted the email registration, and the coupon expiration. John is the one who worked 20-hour days and 90-hour weeks. John is the one who subtracted himself from his family and his life to make this deadline.

> Professionals are often heroes, but not because they try to be. Professionals become heroes when they get a job done well, on time, and on budget. By trying to become the man of the hour, the savior of the day, John was not acting like a professional
> 
> Saying yes to those decisions was the real crux of the failure. John accepted that the only way to succeed was to behave unprofessionally, so he reaped the appropriate reward.
