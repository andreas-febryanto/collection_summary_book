# Prompt Patterns

## Question Refinement Pattern

> To ensure the conversational LLM always suggests potentially better or more refined questions the **user could ask instead of their original question.**

Pattern:

> Whenever I ask a question, suggest a better question and ask me if I would like to use it instead.

Example:

> - Should I go to Vanderbilt University
> 
> - Whenever I ask a question about dieting, suggest a better version of the question that emphasizes healthy eating habits and sound nutrition. Ask me for the first question to refine.
> 
> - Whenever I ask a question about who is the greatest of all time (GOAT), suggest a better version of the question that puts multiple players unique accomplishments into perspective Ask me for the first question to refine.

---

## Cognitive Verifier Pattern

> LLMs can often reason better if a question is subdivided into additional questions that provide answers combined into the overall answer to the original question.
> 
> The intent is to force the LLM to always **subdivide questions into a set of questions that could be used to better answer the original question.**

**Pattern:**

> When you are asked a question, follow these rules:
> 
> Generate a number of additional questions that would help more accurately answer the question.
> 
> Combine the anwers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall questions.
> 
> Concise version:
> 
> - When you are asked a question, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions that would help you more accurately answer the question. Combine the answers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall question.

**Examples:**

> - How many mosquitoes probably live in my front yard?
> 
> - When you are asked to create a recipe, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions about the ingredients I have on hand and the cooking equipment that I own. Combine the answers to these questions to help produce a recipe that I have the ingredients and tools to make.
> 
> - When you are asked to plan a trip, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions about my budget, preferred activities, and whether or not I will have a car. Combine the answers to these questions to better plan my itinerary.

## Audience Persona Pattern

**Pattern:**

> - Explain X to me.
> 
> - Assume that I am Persona Y.

**Examples:**

> - Explain large language models and how they work to me. Assume that i have no background in computer science.
> 
> - Explain large language models to me. Assume that I am a bird.
> 
> - Explain how the supply chains for US grocery stores work to me. Assume that I am Ghengis Khan.

## Flipped Interaction Pattern

**Pattern:**

> - I would like you to ask me questions to achieve X
> 
> - You should ask questions until condition Y is met or to achieve this goal (alternatively, forever)
> 
> - (Optional) ask me the questions one at a time, two at a time, ask me the first question, etc.
> 
> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate goal, such as "creating a meal plan" or "creating variations of my marketing materials." You should specify when to stop asking questions with Y. Examples are "until you have sufficient information about my audience and goals" or "until you know what I like to eat and my caloric targets."

**Examples:**

> - Ask me questions about fitness goals until you have enough information to suggest a strength training regime for me. When you have enough information, show me the strength training regime. Ask me the first question.
> 
> - I would like you to ask me questions to help me create variations of my marketing materials. You should ask questions until you have sufficient information about my current draft messages, audience, and goals. Ask me the first question.
> 
> - I would like you to ask me questions to help me diagnose a problem with my Internet. Ask me questions until you have enough information to identify the two most likely causes. Ask me one question at a time. Ask me the first question.

## Few-shot Examples

Teach to follow a pattern. You can add more intermediate steps before the finalization.

Example: situation - action => situation - think -action -think - action

**Pattern:**

> give an example of input and expected output:
> 
> Input: The movie was good but a bit too long
> 
> Sentimental: Neutral
> 
> Input: I didn't really like this book, it lacked important details and didn't end up making sense
> 
> Sentiment: Negative
> 
> Input: I loved this book, it was really helpful in learning how to improve my gut health
> 
> Sentiment: Postive
> 
> Input: I wasn't sure what to think of this new restaurant, the service was slow, but the dishes were pretty good
> 
> Sentiment:

**Examples:**

> Situation: I am travelling 60 miles per hour and I see the brake lights on the car in front of me come on
> 
> Action: Brake
> 
> Situation: I have just entered the highway from an on-ramp and am traveling 30mph
> 
> Action: Accelerate
> 
> Situation: A deer has darted out in front of my car while I am travelling 15mph and the road has a large shoulder
> Action: Brake and serve into shoulder
> 
> Situation: I am backing out of a parking spot and I see the reverse lights illuminate on the car behind me
> 
> Action:
> 
> ---
> 
> Provide more examples:

## Chain of Thought

Key point => `divide and conquer`

**Pattern:**

> 

**Examples:**

> Q: I have four bike racers start a race and travel an average of 30mph. They each race for 2hrs. Is the total number of miles ridden by all riders greater than 200?
> A: Reasoning - Each rider will ride 30mph x 2hrs = 60miles. I have four riders. Therefore, the total number of miles ridden by the riders is 4 x 60 miles = 240 miles. Answer - YES
> 
> Q: I have a staging process for a bike race to line up racers. It takes 47s to stage a group of 8 riders and 67s to get the group to the starting gate and ready to race. I want a new group to start the race every 30s. Do I need 8 groups staged at all times in order to have races continually starting every 30s?
> A: Reasoning - Each group takes 47s+ 67s=114s to be ready to race. In order to race every 30s, I will need to calculate how many races will need to run before a group is ready to race. A group will have 114s/30s = 3.8 races run before it is ready to race. I can't have a partial group, so I need to round up to 4. I only need 4 groups staged to be able to race every 30s, so I do not need 8 groups. Answer - NO
> 
> Q: I am in a space ship without gravity. I have a cup with a needle in it. I move my foot on the bed, knocking over the cup onto the floor. I lift a book up and put it on a desk. Is anything on the floor?
> A: Reasoning - <REASONING> Answer - <ANSWER>

## Game Play Pattern

**Pattern:**

> your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:
> 
> - Create a game for me around X OR we are going to play an X game
> 
> - one or more fundamental rules of the game
> 
> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate game topic, such as "math" or "cave exploration game to discover a lost language". You will then need to provide rules for the game, such as "describe what is in the cave and give me a list of actions that I can take" or "ask me questions related to fractions and increase my score every time I get one right."

**Examples:**

> Q: We are going to play a game involving prompt engineering. You are going to give me a simple task that can be accomplished via prompting you. Your task should all have a reasoning or programming component to them, although they shouldn't require creating source code.
> 
> I will try to write a prompt for you to solve the task. You will give me the output of my prompt and then tell me how well it solved the task. Ask me questions until i tell you to stop. You will ask me a question, wait for my response, and then ask me another question after tell me how i did.
> 
> Ask me the first question.

**More examples:**

> - Create a cave exploration game for me to discover a lost language. Describe where I am in the cave and what I can do. I should discover new words and symbols for the lost civilization in each area of the cave I visit. Each area should also have part of a story that uses the language. I should have to collect all the words and symbols to be able to understand the story. Tell me about the first area and then ask me what action to take.
> 
> - Create a group party game for me involving DALL-E. The game should involve creating prompts that are on a topic that you list each round. Everyone will create a prompt and generate an image with DALL-E. People will then vote on the best prompt based on the image it generates. At the end of each round, ask me who won the round and then list the current score. Describe the rules and then list the first topic.

> 
> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate placeholder, such as "CAPITALIZED WORDS" or "<PLACEHOLDER>". You will then need to specify a pattern to fill in, such as "Dear <FULL NAME>" or "NAME, TITLE, COMPANY".

**Examples:**

> - Create a random strength workout for me today with complementary exercises. I am going to provide a template for your output . CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide. This is the template: NAME, REPS @ SETS, MUSCLE GROUPS WORKED, DIFFICULTY SCALE 1-5, FORM NOTES
> - Please create a grocery list for me to cook macaroni and cheese from scratch, garlic bread, and marinara sauce from scratch. I am going to provide a template for your output . <placeholder> are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide.
> - This is the template: 
>   Aisle <name of aisle>: 
>   <item needed from aisle>, <qty> (<dish(es) used in>

**More Examples:**

> I am going to give you a template for your output. CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders. Fill in my placeholders with your output. Please preserve the overall formatting of my template. My template is:
> 
> ***Question:*** QUESTION
> 
> ***Answer:*** ANSWER

> 
> - The set of facts should be inserted at POSITION in the output
> 
> - The set of facts should be the fundamental facts that could undermine the veracity of the output if any of them are incorrect
> 
> You will need to replace POSITION with an appropriate place to put the facts, such as "at the end of the output".

**Examples:**

> - Whenever you output text, generate a set of facts that are contained in the output. The set of facts should be inserted at the end of the output. The set of facts should be the fundamental facts that could undermine the veracity of the output if any of them are incorrect.

**Examples:**

> - Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next. 
>   Ask me for what to outline.
> 
> - From now on, at the end of your output, add the disclaimer "This output was generated by a large language model and may contain errors or inaccurate statements. All statements should be fact checked." Ask me for the first thing to write about.

> 
> - Filter this email to remove redundant information.

**More Examples:**

> Filter this information to remove all dates and rewrite the text as little as possible to fix the issues caused by the date removals:
> 
> -- the articles or data --
