# Prompt Patterns

## Question Refinement Pattern

> To ensure the conversational LLM always suggests potentially better or more refined questions the **user could ask instead of their original question.**

Pattern:

> Whenever I ask a question, suggest a better question and ask me if I would like to use it instead.

Example:

> - Should I go to Vanderbilt University
> 
> - Whenever I ask a question about dieting, suggest a better version of the question that emphasizes healthy eating habits and sound nutrition. Ask me for the first question to refine.
> 
> - Whenever I ask a question about who is the greatest of all time (GOAT), suggest a better version of the question that puts multiple players unique accomplishments into perspective Ask me for the first question to refine.

## Cognitive Verifier Pattern

> LLMs can often reason better if a question is subdivided into additional questions that provide answers combined into the overall answer to the original question.
> 
> The intent is to force the LLM to always **subdivide questions into a set of questions that could be used to better answer the original question.**

**Pattern:**

> When you are asked a question, follow these rules:
> 
> Generate a number of additional questions that would help more accurately answer the question.
> 
> Combine the anwers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall questions.
> 
> Concise version:
> 
> - When you are asked a question, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions that would help you more accurately answer the question. Combine the answers to the individual questions to produce the final answer to the overall question.

**Examples:**

> - How many mosquitoes probably live in my front yard?
> 
> - When you are asked to create a recipe, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions about the ingredients I have on hand and the cooking equipment that I own. Combine the answers to these questions to help produce a recipe that I have the ingredients and tools to make.
> 
> - When you are asked to plan a trip, follow these rules. Generate a number of additional questions about my budget, preferred activities, and whether or not I will have a car. Combine the answers to these questions to better plan my itinerary.

## Audience Persona Pattern

**Pattern:**

> - Explain X to me.
> 
> - Assume that I am Persona Y.

**Examples:**

> - Explain large language models and how they work to me. Assume that i have no background in computer science.
> 
> - Explain large language models to me. Assume that I am a bird.
> 
> - Explain how the supply chains for US grocery stores work to me. Assume that I am Ghengis Khan.

## Flipped Interaction Pattern

**Pattern:**

> - I would like you to ask me questions to achieve X
> 
> - You should ask questions until condition Y is met or to achieve this goal (alternatively, forever)
> 
> - (Optional) ask me the questions one at a time, two at a time, ask me the first question, etc.
> 
> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate goal, such as "creating a meal plan" or "creating variations of my marketing materials." You should specify when to stop asking questions with Y. Examples are "until you have sufficient information about my audience and goals" or "until you know what I like to eat and my caloric targets."

**Examples:**

> - Ask me questions about fitness goals until you have enough information to suggest a strength training regime for me. When you have enough information, show me the strength training regime. Ask me the first question.
> 
> - I would like you to ask me questions to help me create variations of my marketing materials. You should ask questions until you have sufficient information about my current draft messages, audience, and goals. Ask me the first question.
> 
> - I would like you to ask me questions to help me diagnose a problem with my Internet. Ask me questions until you have enough information to identify the two most likely causes. Ask me one question at a time. Ask me the first question.

> 
> - I am going to provide a template for your output
> 
> - X is my placeholder for content
> 
> - Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list
> 
> - Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide
> 
> - This is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLDERS
> 
> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate placeholder, such as "CAPITALIZED WORDS" or "<PLACEHOLDER>". You will then need to specify a pattern to fill in, such as "Dear <FULL NAME>" or "NAME, TITLE, COMPANY".

**Examples:**

> - Create a random strength workout for me today with complementary exercises. I am going to provide a template for your output . CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide. This is the template: NAME, REPS @ SETS, MUSCLE GROUPS WORKED, DIFFICULTY SCALE 1-5, FORM NOTES
> - Please create a grocery list for me to cook macaroni and cheese from scratch, garlic bread, and marinara sauce from scratch. I am going to provide a template for your output . <placeholder> are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide.
> - This is the template: 
>   Aisle <name of aisle>: 
>   <item needed from aisle>, <qty> (<dish(es) used in>

**More Examples:**

> I am going to give you a template for your output. CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders. Fill in my placeholders with your output. Please preserve the overall formatting of my template. My template is:
> 
> ***Question:*** QUESTION
> 
> ***Answer:*** ANSWER
> 
> I will give you the data to format in the next prompt. Create twenty questions using my template.

## Meta Language Creation Pattern

**Pattern:**

> To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:
> 
> - When I say X, I mean Y (or would like you to do Y)

> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate statement, symbol, word, etc. You will then need to may this to a meaning, Y.

**Examples:**

> - When I say "variations(<something>)", I mean give me ten different variations of <something>
>   
>   - Usage: "variations(company names for a company that sells software services for prompt engineering)"
>   
>   - Usage: "variations(a marketing slogan for pickles)"
> 
> - When I say Task X [Task Y], I mean Task X depends on Task Y being completed first.
>

>   
>   - Usage: "Provide an ordering for the steps: Boil Water [Turn on Stove], Cook Pasta [Boil Water], Make Marinara [Turn on Stove], Turn on Stove [Go Into Kitchen]"

**More Examples:**

> We are goint to create a trip planning application. I will describe my trip and you will list interesting things to do in places that i will pass through. I will tell you how many days i will stay in each place and you will list possible itineraries.
> 
> To describe my route, I am going to use a shorthand notation.

> - Fill in any missing steps
> 
> - (Optional) Identify any unnecessary steps
> 
> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate task. You will then need to specify the steps A, B, C that you know need to be part of the recipe / complete plan.

> 
> - For anything that I ask you to write, determine the underlying problem that I am trying to solve and how I am trying to solve it. List at least one alternative approach to solve the problem and compare / contrast the approach with the original approach implied by my request to you.

**More Examples:**

> From now on, if there are alternative ways to accomplish the same thing, list the best alternat approaches. Compare and contrast the alternatives and ask me which one i want to use.
> 
> - Write a prompt for ChatGPT using few shot examples to determine if a date in YYYY-MM-DD format is a leap year. The output should either be "YYYY is a leap year" or "this is not a leap year".

## Outline Expansion Patterns

**Pattern:**

> To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:
> 
> - Act as an outline expander.
> 
> - Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on.
> 
> - Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select.
> 
> - At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next.
> 
> - Ask me for what to outline.

**Examples:**

> - Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Each bullet can have at most 3-5 sub bullets. The bullets should be numbered using the pattern [A-Z].[i-v].[* through ****]. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next. Ask me for what to outline.

**More Examples:**

> - Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next.

## Tail Generation Pattern

**Pattern:**

> To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:
> 
> - At the end, repeat Y and/or ask me for X.

> You will need to replace "Y" with what the model should repeat, such as "repeat my list of options", and X with what it should ask for, "for the next action". These statements usually need to be at the end of the prompt or next to last.

**Examples:**

> - Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select. At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next. 
>   Ask me for what to outline.
> 
> - From now on, at the end of your output, add the disclaimer "This output was generated by a large language model and may contain errors or inaccurate statements. All statements should be fact checked." Ask me for the first thing to write about.

**More Examples:**

> Whenever I ask you to write a prompt for me to accomplish a task, list what the task is, list alternative approaches for completing the task, and then write a prompt for yourself for each approach.
> 
> (tail secion) When you are done, ask me for the next prompt to create alternatives for.
> 
> Ask me what I want you to write a prompt for
> 
> - Write a prompt for ChatGPT to automatically detect questions in a chain of emails and summarize everyones opinion on the questions as bullet points beneath each question.

## Semantic Filter Pattern

**Pattern:**

> To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:
> 
> - Filter this information to remove X
> 
> You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate definition of what you want to remove, such as. "names and dates" or "costs greater than $100".

**Examples:**

> - Filter this information to remove any personally identifying information or information that could potentially be used to re-identify the person.
> 
> - Filter this email to remove redundant information.

**More Examples:**

> Filter this information to remove all dates and rewrite the text as little as possible to fix the issues caused by the date removals:
> 
> -- the articles or data --
